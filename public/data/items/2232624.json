Ltd.”\n\n                              Posted On:\n                25 FEB 2026 1:21PM by PIB Delhi\n\nStrengthening India’s animal health ecosystem and advancing self-reliance in critical veterinary inputs, the Technology Development Board (TDB), Department of Science & Technology, Government of India, has sanctioned financial assistance to M/s Biovet Private Limited, Malur, for the project titled\n“Development and Commercialization of Veterinary Hormones.”\n\nThe project aims to establish a dedicated manufacturing facility for the commercial production of key veterinary reproductive hormones, including GnRH analogues—Gonadorelin and Buserelin acetate—and the prostaglandin analogue Cloprostenol. These hormones play a crucial role in livestock reproduction management and therapeutic interventions for reproductive disorders, contributing significantly to sustainable animal production and improved breeding efficiency.\n\nCurrently, there is no commercial-scale production of these hormones indigenously developed in India, leading to dependence on imports and higher costs for farmers. The proposed facility will enable domestic manufacturing of hormone agonists, reducing import reliance, lowering costs, and ensuring wider accessibility for livestock farmers. The initiative is expected to generate substantial foreign exchange savings while also creating export opportunities in the global veterinary market.\n\nWith advancements in biotechnology and bioengineering, hormone synthesis and application have gained increasing relevance in animal healthcare. The project will leverage Biovet’s established expertise in biotechnology-based veterinary products, including biologicals and vaccines, to expand into a specialized vertical of hormone and therapeutic product manufacturing. By integrating indigenous process development with commercial-scale production, the project aims to strengthen India’s capabilities in high-value veterinary pharmaceuticals.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion,\nShri Rajesh Kumar Pathak, Secretary, TDB,\n stated, “Development of indigenous veterinary hormone manufacturing capacity is strategically important for strengthening animal husbandry and supporting farmers’ livelihoods. Through this project, TDB is facilitating import substitution, promoting domestic biotechnology capabilities, and enabling affordable access to critical reproductive therapeutics.”\n\nPromoters of Biovet Private Limited said, “TDB’s support will enable us to establish world-class manufacturing infrastructure for veterinary hormones and serve both domestic and international markets. This initiative will enhance accessibility of essential reproductive therapeutics and contribute to the growth and sustainability of India’s livestock sector.”\n\nThe project aligns with TDB’s mandate to provide financial assistance for the commercialization of indigenous technologies and industrial R&D outcomes. By supporting domestic production of critical veterinary hormones, TDB continues to promote Aatmanirbharta in animal healthcare, strengthen the livestock value chain, and contribute to improved income and productivity for farmers across the country.\n\n******\n\nNKR/FK\n\n(Release ID: 2232624)\n\nVisitor Counter : 279\n\nRead this release in:\n\n                                          Urdu\n\n                                    ,\n\n                                          हिन्दी\n\n                                    Ministry of Science & Technology\n\n                                          “TDB-DST Supports Indigenous Commercial Production of Veterinary Hormones by Biovet Pvt.
