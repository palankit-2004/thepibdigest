He encouraged the officers to work with honesty and integrity to further India’s positive image. He told them that, while conducting their duties abroad, they should always remember that they represent the aspirations of 1.4 billion Indians. He urged them to remain open to new ideas, people, and perspectives from every culture and carry with them the values of India’s civilisational wisdom. He congratulated them for putting in hard work to join the coveted IFS.\n\nBefore the interaction, the trainee-officers were briefed on various defence diplomacy initiatives, defence budget, Tri-service integration and defence acquisition by officials from verticals of the Ministry of Defence.
