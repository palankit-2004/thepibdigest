The expedition was led by Indian Army’s Regiment of Artillery. Flagging in the expedition, the COAS lauded the initiative for its national significance and strategic outreach value. He emphasised that such endeavours preserve India’s rich heritage while inspiring present and future generations to uphold the highest ideals of service to the nation. The expedition also promoted the RanBhoomi Darshan initiative, bringing national attention to historically significant battlefields and border regions that form the bedrock of India’s security narrative.\n\nFlagged off on 03 February 2026 from the coastal city of Dwarka in Gujarat, the 3,400-kilometre SUV expedition traversed key battlefields and forward areas across Gujarat and Rajasthan, including the Rann of Kutch and the Thar Desert, before culminating at the National War Memorial in New Delhi. The route included Dwarka, Bhuj, Rann of Kutch, Munabao, Gadra, Longewala, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Ambala and New Delhi. The expedition travelled along border roads and tracks, showcasing enhanced connectivity in remote border areas, highlighting the improved infrastructure that supports operational readiness and civilian access alike.\n\nThe 35-member contingent comprised Gunners from the Regiment of Artillery, along with personnel from the Indian Navy and the Border Security Force. The expedition was aligned with the national vision of border outreach and national integration. Throughout the journey, the team paid homage at prominent war memorials and historic battle sites along the Western Front, honouring India’s Bravehearts who made the supreme sacrifice in service of the nation. The expedition also served as a powerful outreach initiative, engaging with\nVeer Naris, Viranganas\n, veterans, NCC cadets, students and residents of border areas. The warmth and respect extended by civil authorities and local communities at every halt underscored the deep bond between the forces and the citizens they safeguard.\n\nThe successful culmination of the first Bharat RanBhoomi Darshan Expedition stands as a testament to the Armed Forces’ enduring commitment to honour the past, engage the present and inspire the future - linking India’s heroic sacrifices with its aspirations for a secure, united and resilient tomorrow.\n\n****\n\nNA/PK\n\n(Release ID: 2232701)\n\nVisitor Counter : 550\n\nRead this release in:\n\n                                          Urdu\n\n                                    ,\n\n                                          हिन्दी\n\n                                    ,\n\n                                          Marathi\n\n                                    ,\n\n                                          Tamil\n\n                                    Ministry of Defence\n\n                                          GENERAL UPENDRA DWIVEDI, CHIEF OF THE ARMY STAFF FLAGS IN BHARAT RANBHOOMI DARSHAN EXPEDITION\n\n                                          Posted On:\n                        25 FEB 2026 4:41PM by PIB Delhi\n\nGeneral Upendra Dwivedi, Chief of the Army Staff (COAS), flagged in the Bharat RanBhoomi Darshan Expedition at the National War Memorial, New Delhi today, in the presence of distinguished civil and defence dignitaries.
