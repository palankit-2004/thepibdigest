Special focus is given to how comfort, accessibility, and affordability were prioritised, particularly for senior citizens and first-time pilgrims through policy support and state subsidies. At its core, the book chronicles the conception, evolution, and successful execution of the Karnataka Bharat Gaurav Train under the Bharat Gaurav Policy.\n\nKarnataka Bharat Gaurav Train\n\nThe Karnataka Bharat Gaurav Train represents a flagship pilgrimage tourism initiative under Indian Railways’ Bharat Gaurav Policy. It repositions Railways from a mere transporter to an enabler of tourism, culture, and spiritual connectivity. The initiative aligns with national programmes such as “Dekho Apna Desh” and “Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat,” fostering national integration through shared spiritual experiences.\n\nThrough themed journeys such as Kashi Darshan, Jyotirlinga Darshan, Shakti Peetha Yatra, Dakshina Yatra, Dwarka Yatra, and Puri Jagannath Yatra, the train connects Karnataka pilgrims to major spiritual destinations across India. The all-inclusive packages cover rail travel, vegetarian meals, accommodation, local transportation, tour guides, and sightseeing, ensuring a seamless and dignified experience.\n\nAs of the latest data, 46 trips have been successfully operated with 28,786 pilgrims travelling, generating approximately ₹25.57 crore in earnings for Indian Railways while advancing the larger objective of inclusive pilgrimage tourism.\n\n*****\n\nDharmendra Tewari/ Dr. Nayan Solanki/ Manik Sharma\n\n(Release ID: 2232731)\n\nVisitor Counter : 211\n\nRead this release in:\n\n                                          Urdu\n\n                                    ,\n\n                                          हिन्दी\n\n                                    ,\n\n                                          Tamil\n\n                                    ,\n\n                                          Kannada\n\n                                    Ministry of Railways\n\n                                          Shri V.
