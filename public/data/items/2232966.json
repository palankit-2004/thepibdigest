Ltd. for Commercialization of Eco-Friendly Ultra-Low Carbon Wall Claddings”\n\nPosted On:\n26 FEB 2026 11:50AM by PIB Delhi\n\nIn line with the Government of India’s commitment to promoting sustainable industrial growth and circular economy practices, the Technology Development Board (TDB), Department of Science & Technology, has signed an agreement with Carbon Craft Design Pvt. Ltd. for financial assistance to support the commercialization of eco-friendly, ultra-low carbon footprint wall claddings.\n\nThe project, titled\n“Commercialization of the Eco-friendly Ultra Low Carbon Footprint Wall Claddings”\n, entails the establishment of a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for geopolymer-based tiles developed using indigenous technology.\n\nCarbonCraft is a design and material innovation startup focused on developing ultra-low carbon, circular economy-based building materials utilizing construction and demolition waste. The company’s proprietary technology enables the permanent sequestration of industrial byproducts into value-added products such as tiles, aggregates, and bricks. The proposed geopolymer wall claddings are sustainable, high-performance tiles manufactured using recycled quartz waste and multi-grade quartz sand through specialized processing and blending techniques, eliminating the need for energy-intensive kiln firing.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion,\nShri Rajesh Kumar Pathak, Secretary, TDB,\n stated, “The transition to sustainable construction materials is critical for achieving India’s climate goals and net-zero ambitions. By supporting innovative startups like Carbon Craft, TDB is enabling the commercialization of indigenous technologies that reduce carbon footprint, promote waste valorisation, and strengthen India’s green manufacturing ecosystem.”\n\nFounders of Carbon Craft Design Pvt. Ltd. expressed gratitude for TDB’s support and noted that the assistance would accelerate the scale-up of manufacturing capabilities and expand market access for sustainable building materials. The company reaffirmed its commitment to advancing low-carbon construction solutions aligned with the principles of circular economy and Aatmanirbhar Bharat.\n\nThe project is expected to contribute to import substitution in specialized architectural cladding materials, reduce industrial waste, and promote environmentally responsible construction practices across the country, reinforcing India’s vision of sustainable and self-reliant growth.\n\n*****\n\nNKR/FK\n\n\n\n(Release ID: 2232966)\n\nVisitor Counter : 137\n\nRead this release in:\n\nUrdu\n\n,\n\nहिन्दी\n\nMinistry of Science & Technology\n\n“TDB-DST supports Carbon Craft Design Pvt.
