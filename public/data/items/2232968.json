Ltd. for Development of ‘Autoscope’ – An AI-Driven Whole Slide Imaging Diagnostic System”\n\nPosted On:\n26 FEB 2026 11:53AM by PIB Delhi\n\nIn furtherance of the Government of India’s vision to promote deep-tech innovation and technological self-reliance in healthcare, the Technology Development Board (TDB), Department of Science & Technology (DST), has entered into an agreement with M/s Ayukriyam Innovations Pvt. Ltd. for the project titled\n“Autoscope: A Fully Automated Whole Slide Imaging and AI-Driven Diagnostic System.”\n\nAyukriyam Innovations Pvt. Ltd. is a deep-tech spin-off from the Molecular Imaging & Diagnostics Lab in the Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. The company is focused on advancing healthcare diagnostics through cutting-edge microscopy systems integrated with artificial intelligence to enable rapid, accurate, and deployable diagnosis of infectious diseases, particularly in resource-constrained settings.\n\nThe Autoscope platform is being developed as a fully automated whole slide imaging system combined with AI-driven diagnostic capabilities. The system aims to address critical gaps in pathology infrastructure by offering high-throughput, standardized, and scalable diagnostic workflows. By leveraging indigenous R&D and AI-enabled image analytics, the technology seeks to enhance diagnostic accuracy while reducing dependence on imported high-end imaging systems.\n\nThe sanctioned assistance from TDB will support the establishment of a dedicated manufacturing facility, production of multiple product batches, and comprehensive field performance evaluations. The project is expected to facilitate commercialization of an indigenously developed deep-tech platform, strengthen India’s diagnostic ecosystem, and contribute to affordable and accessible healthcare solutions.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion,\nShri Rajesh Kumar Pathak, Secretary, TDB,\n stated, “Indigenous development of advanced diagnostic platforms integrating imaging and artificial intelligence is vital for strengthening India’s healthcare infrastructure. Through this support, TDB aims to accelerate the translation of laboratory innovation into market-ready solutions, reduce import dependence, and promote Aatmanirbhar Bharat in the medical technology sector.”\n\nPromoters of Ayukriyam Innovations Pvt. Ltd. expressed gratitude to TDB for the support and noted that the assistance would significantly accelerate manufacturing readiness and field deployment of the Autoscope platform, enabling wider access to reliable and technology-driven diagnostics across the country.\n\nThe project reinforces TDB’s mandate to provide financial assistance for commercialization of indigenous technologies developed through in-house R&D and institutional linkages, and underscores the Government of India’s continued commitment to fostering innovation-led growth in critical sectors such as healthcare and medical devices.\n\n******\n\nNKR/FK\n\n\n\n(Release ID: 2232968)\n\nVisitor Counter : 267\n\nRead this release in:\n\nUrdu\n\n,\n\nहिन्दी\n\nMinistry of Science & Technology\n\n“TDB supports Ayukriyam Innovations Pvt.
