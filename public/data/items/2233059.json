It is a major milestone in post-disaster recovery efforts by BRO following the devastating cloud bursts in May-June 2025, Cyclone Remal in June 2024 and the Glacial Lake Outburst Flood in October 2023.\n\nTo restore the Lines of Communication, BRO cleared 96 landslides, constructed four major bridges, and repaired two others under Project Swastik. The BRO engineering team completed eight kilometers of fresh formation cutting and created various diversions to navigate unstable slopes and sinking zones. These efforts follow the opening of the 7.5 km Naga-Toong stretch in October 2025, which further established connectivity in the region. The completion of the 28 km Chungthang-Lachen road and the Taram Chu Bridge will cater the needs of local residents, security agencies and boost regional economic activities.\n\nRRM noted that these assets are pivotal to the infrastructure development of North Sikkim and the well-being of locals. He acknowledged the Border Roads Organisation for their consistent work in the region. The inauguration of these vital road connectivity assets align with the ‘Atmanirbhar Sikkim-Viksit Bharat Vision’ outlined by the Chief Minister of Sikkim.\n\n***\n\nVK/SR/Ruchi\n\n(Release ID: 2233059)\n\nVisitor Counter : 356\n\nRead this release in:\n\nUrdu\n\n,\n\nहिन्दी\n\n,\n\nMarathi\n\n,\n\nTamil\n\nMinistry of Defence\n\nRaksha Rajya Mantri inaugurates Chungthang-Lachen Axis and Taram Chu Bridge in Sikkim\n\nPosted On:\n26 FEB 2026 3:27PM by PIB Delhi\n\nRaksha Rajya Mantri Shri Sanjay Seth inaugurated Chungthang – Lachen axis and a 400 ft Bailey Suspension Taram Chu Bridge in North Sikkim restored by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO).
