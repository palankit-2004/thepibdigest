  "text": "Press Release:Press Information Bureau\n\nMinistry of Science & Technology\n\nStrategic technology transfer advances farmer-led innovation\n\nPosted On:\n26 FEB 2026 4:09PM by PIB Delhi\n\nThree high yielding varieties of wheat and two high yielding varieties of peas developed by farmer innovators from Varanasi with support from National Innovation Foundation - India (NIF) have been transferred to a Nagpur based company through agreements to enable their commercialisation.\n\nThe NIF, an autonomous institution of the Department of Science and Technology (DST) has facilitated transfer agreements for the transfer of five plant varieties (two Pigeon Pea and three Wheat varieties) developed by farmer innovators Shri Shreeprakash Singh Raghuvanshi and Shri Ranjeet Kumar Singh of Varanasi to Nagpur based Ginni Agro Products Limited (GAPL).\n\nGAPL has secured commercialization rights for a total of five varieties - Kudrat 3 (Pigeon pea); Kudrat 8 & Kudrat 9 (Wheat) developed by the innovator Shri Shreeprakash Singh while two varieties Lalita (Pigeon pea) and Annapurna (Wheat) developed by Shri Ranjeet Kumar Singh. The agreements allow GAPL for seed production, multiplication, processing, marketing and sale as TL (Truthfully Labelled) seed in designated territories including Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and parts of Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe agreements will integrate grassroots innovations into formal business and strengthen the farmers’ right. The collaboration is expected to enhance the availability of quality seeds to farmers, improve agricultural productivity and generate sustainable income opportunities for the innovators.\n\nKudrat-8 (Wheat):\n A high-yielding variety (up to 65.41q/ha) with average 50 grains per spike and a higher test weight of 52 g. The dwarf structure of plant (76 cm height) prevents lodging and more number of tillers (390/m\n2\n) with higher biomass (18g/plant) supports additional benefit to the farmers. It was noticed moderately resistant to aphid and resistant to leaf rust.\n\nKudrat-9 (Wheat):\n Demonstrates a high-yielding (yield potential up to 67 q/ha), bio-fortified cultivar with significant potential for enhancing nutritional security. Characterized by a superior grain profile containing 10-12% protein, 47.58 ppm Fe, and 23.77 ppm Zn, it addresses critical micronutrient deficiencies.\n\nAnnapurna (Wheat):\n It represents high yield potential (up to 60 q/ha) driven by its superior panicle architecture, characterized by a 25 cm panicle length and a high grain density up to 80 long-bold seeds per panicle.\n\nKudrat-3 (Pigeon Pea):\n The two harvests per year capability of this perennial variety ensures significantly higher cumulative annual yield up to 36.17 q/ha. It outperformed all check varieties (max yield: 3253.70 kg/ha), features 6–8 cm long pods with average 5 bold seeds, and is suitable for both green pod and grain use. The sweeter dry seeds with red seed coat can be sold as \"Whole Arhar\" or processed into “Dal” having bright yellow colour.\n\nLalita (Pigeon Pea):\n An annual variety with\nhigher yield potential up to 30 quintals/ha.\n,\nThe round shape of red seed avoids breakage during milling and provide higher\nDal\n recovery over 80%. It fits well in organic cultivation too.\n\nKudrat 8 wheat\n\n\n\nKudrat 9 Wheat\n\nAnnpurna Wheat                                          Kudrat 3 Pigeon Pea\n\nLalita Pigeon Pea\n\nFor more details contact at\nraishm@nifindia.org\n.\n\n****\n\nNKR/FK\n\n(Release ID: 2233097)\n\nVisitor Counter : 100\n\nRead this release in:\n\nUrdu\n\n,\n\nहिन्दी\n\nMinistry of Science & Technology\n\nStrategic technology transfer advances farmer-led innovation\n\nPosted On:\n26 FEB 2026 4:09PM by PIB Delhi\n\nThree high yielding varieties of wheat and two high yielding varieties of peas developed by farmer innovators from Varanasi with support from National Innovation Foundation - India (NIF) have been transferred to a Nagpur based company through agreements to enable their commercialisation.\n\nThe NIF, an autonomous institution of the Department of Science and Technology (DST) has facilitated transfer agreements for the transfer of five plant varieties (two Pigeon Pea and three Wheat varieties) developed by farmer innovators Shri Shreeprakash Singh Raghuvanshi and Shri Ranjeet Kumar Singh of Varanasi to Nagpur based Ginni Agro Products Limited (GAPL).\n\nGAPL has secured commercialization rights for a total of five varieties - Kudrat 3 (Pigeon pea); Kudrat 8 & Kudrat 9 (Wheat) developed by the innovator Shri Shreeprakash Singh while two varieties Lalita (Pigeon pea) and Annapurna (Wheat) developed by Shri Ranjeet Kumar Singh.
