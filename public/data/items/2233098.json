Saraswat, Minister for IT, Finance, Planning and Coordination Shri Pranajit Singha Roy, Chief Secretary Shri Jitendra Kumar Sinha, IT Secretary Shri Rajiv Kumar Sen, Managing Director NeGD Shri Kiran Gitte, along with senior officials, startup founders, innovators, students, and industry representatives. Dr. Jitendra Singh described the launch of SIM in Tripura as a natural progression of the Atal Innovation Mission (AIM), an initiative envisioned by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. Recalling that the concept of innovation missions was once unfamiliar in government systems, he said AIM has, over the last several years, transformed into a nationwide movement. From the establishment of nearly 10,000 Atal Tinkering Labs (ATLs) to the recent decision to expand to 50,000 more, the innovation ecosystem now reaches deep into districts and small towns, inspiring school students across the country.\n\nThe Minister said that the decision of the Union Cabinet to extend AIM and promote State Innovation Missions across States and Union Territories reflects the spirit of cooperative and competitive federalism. Tripura, under the leadership of Chief Minister Prof. (Dr.) Manik Saha, has taken the lead, setting an example for the rest of the country. The Minister described this as a demonstration of the “double engine” approach, where national vision and state-level execution work in tandem.\n\nRecalling the Prime Minister’s emphasis since 2014 that balanced national development requires equal progress across regions, Dr. Jitendra Singh spoke about the transformation of the Northeast over the last decade. He referred to improved connectivity, expansion of rail and air infrastructure, growing tourism, and greater national integration, saying the region has moved from isolation to mainstream participation in India’s growth story.\n\nHighlighting Tripura’s performance in entrepreneurship, the Minister shared that the state today has over 150 registered startups, recording an average growth of around 66 percent in startup recognitions over the last five years. A significant share of these ventures is women-led, positioning Tripura as a leader in gender-inclusive innovation in the Northeast. He added that the launch of SIM will further support commercialization of innovative ideas and strengthen the startup ecosystem.\n\nDr. Jitendra Singh also pointed to Tripura’s strong MSME base, with more than 3.13 lakh registered MSMEs on the Udyam portal as of early 2026, including over 1.18 lakh formal Udyam registrations and nearly 2 lakh micro-enterprises supported through the Udyam Assist Platform. He said the growth of MSMEs will receive fresh momentum through SIM, contributing to employment generation and local economic expansion.\n\nReferring to the country’s broader startup journey, he noted that India has grown from a few hundred startups in 2014 to over two lakhs today, generating more than 21 lakh jobs, with nearly half emerging from Tier-II and Tier-III cities. A substantial number are women-led enterprises, reflecting a widespread aspirational surge across the country.\n\nThe Minister spoke about Tripura’s unique strengths, particularly its bamboo and rubber resources, and said these can drive high-value manufacturing, including applications linked to the defence sector, biofuel for aerospace and specialized materials. He emphasized that leveraging local strengths for national priorities would define the next phase of growth.\n\nDr. Jitendra Singh also referred to recent policy initiatives supporting deep-tech and research-driven enterprises, including a Rs 10,000 crore Fund of Funds for deep-tech startups, relaxation of sustainability conditions for CSIR-backed startups, and the launch of a Rs 1 lakh crore Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) Fund to help enterprises scale up. He said these measures demonstrate the government’s commitment to risk-taking, innovation and public-private partnership.\n\nReferring to the recent AI Impact Summit held in New Delhi; he said the future of governance and enterprise will be shaped by technology that serves humanity. He expressed confidence that SIM Tripura will integrate Artificial Intelligence and digital tools into state programs, aligning with national priorities such as Digital India and Ease of Living reforms. Technology, he said, must promote equity by reaching the unreached and empowering the underserved.\n\nCalling innovation a collective responsibility, Dr. Jitendra Singh said the goal is to build an ecosystem where a student in a remote village, a startup founder in a small town and a researcher in a state university feel equally empowered to contribute to India’s development. He urged greater participation from the private sector, adding that sectors once considered closed, including nuclear energy, have now been opened to wider collaboration.\n\nConcluding, he said Tripura’s journey sends a powerful message: when vision meets execution and policy meets participation, transformation becomes inevitable. He called for sustained collaboration between Centre and State, public and private sectors, and science and society to ensure that India’s innovation decade becomes India’s defining century.\n\n*****\n\nNKR/AK\n\n(Release ID: 2233098)\n\nVisitor Counter : 186\n\nRead this release in:\n\nUrdu\n\n,\n\nहिन्दी\n\n,\n\nBengali-TR\n\nMinistry of Science & Technology\n\n“When States Innovate, India Accelerates”: Dr Jitendra Singh Launches India’s First State Innovation Mission (SIM) in Tripura\n\nSIM to Institutionalize District-Level Innovation Ecosystem in Tripura, Support Commercialization of Local Ideas into Scalable Startups: Dr Jitendra Singh\nOver 3.13 Lakh MSMEs Registered in Tripura; SIM to Accelerate Local Enterprise Ecosystem: Dr Jitendra Singh\nTripura Records 66% Surge in Startup Recognitions; Technology Must Drive Equity and Inclusion, Says Dr Jitendra Singh at SIM Event\nGovernment Removes Barriers for Deep-Tech Startups; Greater Risk-Taking to Encourage Innovation: Dr Jitendra Singh\nExpansion of 50,000 new Atal Tinkering Labs to Deepen Grassroots Innovation Across India: Dr Jitendra Singh\n\nPosted On:\n26 FEB 2026 4:16PM by PIB Delhi\n\nLaunching India’s first State Innovation Mission (SIM) in Agartala on 26 February 2026, Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences, MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that innovation must move beyond laboratories and metropolitan corridors to districts, villages, and every citizen whose aspirations define the idea of a New India.\n\nDescribing the Northeast as the “New Engine” of India’s growth, the Minister said, Tripura’s initiative marks a decisive step toward decentralizing technology and democratizing opportunity.\n\nThe SIM Tripura launch was attended by Chief Minister of Tripura Prof. (Dr.) Manik Saha, Chairman NITI Aayog Shri Suman Bery, Member NITI Aayog Dr. V.K.
