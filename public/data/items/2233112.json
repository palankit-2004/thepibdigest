On this occasion, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Nityanand Rai, Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar Shri Samrat Choudhary, the Union Home Secretary, Director of the Intelligence Bureau, Secretary (Border Management), Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Director General of SSB, along with several other dignitaries, were present.\n\nIn his address, Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation Shri Amit Shah said that today various projects worth about ₹170 crore have been inaugurated and foundation stones laid to enhance the facilities for personnel of the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB). He said that since 2014, the government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Ji has prepared a compassionate action plan to improve facilities for personnel of all Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), and today’s foundation-laying and inauguration ceremonies have been carried out under this initiative.\n\nUnion Home Minister said that today several projects related to SSB, were inaugurated and foundation stones were laid here. He said that under the India–Nepal Border Road Project, 554 kilometers of border roads have also been approved, out of which work has been completed on 14 of the 18 segments. He added that out of the approved amount of ₹2,468 crore, ₹2,336 crore has already been spent. Shri Shah said that once this road is completed, the surveillance capability of SSB personnel will increase manifold.\n\nShri Amit Shah said that during the elections, we had promised the people of Bihar that we would make the state free from infiltrators. He said that we will not only remove the names of infiltrators from the voter list but will also identify each infiltrator and send them out of India. He added that making the entire country free from infiltrators is not merely an electoral promise but a firm resolve of the Modi government. He said that this initiative will begin with making the entire ‘Seemanchal’ region free from infiltrators.\n\nUnion Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation said that infiltrators not only influence our elections but also take away a share of the food rations meant for the poor, reduce employment opportunities for our youth, and pose a serious threat to national security. He said that the time has come to launch a nationwide campaign at every level to free the country from infiltrators. Shri Shah added that, under this campaign, all illegal encroachments within 10 kilometers of the country’s borders will be removed first.\n\nShri Amit Shah said that demographic change does not contribute to the creation of a healthy society in any country. He said that demographic changes caused by encroachment and infiltration are very dangerous for any country’s culture, history, and geography. The Modi government will provide a permanent solution to this issue.\n\nUnion Home Minister said that the states’ most affected by demographic change are West Bengal, Bihar, and Jharkhand. He said that when our government is formed in West Bengal, the first item on our agenda will be to complete the fencing work along the border and to identify and send every infiltrator out of the country.\n\nShri Amit Shah said that the SSB was once known as the Special Service Bureau and was entrusted with the responsibility of preserving and promoting the cultural identity, history, and traditions of India’s border villages. He said that during the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji, guarding the India–Nepal and India–Bhutan borders was assigned to the SSB. He said that in 2001, the responsibility of securing the 1,751-kilometre-long unfenced India–Nepal border was entrusted to the SSB. In 2004, the SSB was also given the responsibility of guarding the 699-kilometre-long India–Bhutan border. Shri Shah added that SSB personnel have always protected the borders under the most difficult conditions and have consistently cared for the well-being of Indian citizens living in border villages.\n\nUnion Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation said that it cannot be assumed that enemies of the country or elements intending to harm India will not attempt to enter the country through its borders. He said that therefore the SSB must always remain vigilant and keep its intelligence network strong.\n\nShri Amit Shah said that along with securing the borders, the SSB must also keep a close watch on smuggling, narcotics, and other illegal activities. He said that SSB should prepare a Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) capable of assessing all potential threats. He added that while securing open borders, many new dimensions of border security need to be taken into consideration.\n\nUnion Home Minister said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Ji has set a goal of bringing significant improvements in the condition of villages through the Vibrant Villages Programme-1 and Vibrant Villages Programme-2. He said that the Modi government’s priority is to ensure that our personnel and their families receive all necessary facilities.\n\nShri Amit Shah said that today marks the death anniversary of Veer Savarkar Ji. He said that Veer Savarkar Ji was not only an unparalleled warrior of India’s freedom struggle but also a fearless patriot. He added that Veer Savarkar Ji’s writings were equally powerful, and through his prose and poetry Veer Savarkar Ji ignited a wave of patriotism across the country. Shri Shah said that while people earlier referred to the armed uprising of 1857 as a revolt, it was Veer Savarkar Ji who gave it the name of the War of Independence. He said that this perspective inspired the entire nation with the spirit to break the chains of slavery and achieve freedom.\n\n*****\n\nRK/PR/PS/SK\n\n(Release ID: 2233112)\n\nVisitor Counter : 165\n\nRead this release in:\n\nहिन्दी\n\n,\n\nGujarati\n\n,\n\nTamil\n\nMinistry of Home Affairs\n\nUnion Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation Shri Amit Shah  interacts with personnel of SSB in Araria, Bihar, and inaugurates the Border Out Posts at Leti and Inderwa, along with e-inaugurating and laying the e-foundation stones for various SSB projects\n\nUnder the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, it is the Central Government’s priority to ensure that personnel of CAPFs and their families receive all necessary facilities\nOnce our government is formed in Bengal, every infiltrator will be identified and sent out one by one\nMaking Bihar free from infiltrators was not merely an electoral promise; the campaign for an infiltrator-free India will soon begin from the Seemanchal region\nDemographic change caused by infiltration is dangerous for any country’s culture, history, and geography; the Modi govt. will provide a permanent solution to this issue\nAll illegal constructions within 10 kilometers of the border in the Seemanchal region will be demolished\nThrough the Vibrant Villages Programme, the Modi government is bringing about significant improvements in the condition of border villages\nUnion Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation also had lunch with the personnel of the SSB\n\nPosted On:\n26 FEB 2026 4:40PM by PIB Delhi\n\nUnion Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation Shri Amit Shah today interacted with personnel of the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) in Araria, Bihar, and inaugurated the Border Out Posts at Leti and Inderwa, along with e-inaugurating and laying the e-foundation stones for various SSB projects.
