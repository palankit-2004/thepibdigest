  "text": "Press Release:Press Information Bureau\n\nMinistry of Electronics & IT\n\nIndia’s Space Ecosystem Gets Cyber Shield as SIA-India, CERT-In Release Joint Guidelines\n\nPosted On:\n26 FEB 2026 4:55PM by PIB Delhi\n\nSpace cyber security, including Satellite Communication systems, is of paramount importance to India’s space architecture. These systems serve as vital enablers of connectivity across remote and strategic regions, support national security operations, strengthen disaster response mechanisms, facilitate navigation and broadcasting services, and underpin a wide spectrum of economic activities essential to the nation’s growth and resilience.\n\nThe Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India in collaboration with SIA-India has developed a comprehensive framework and guidelines for Space Cyber Security for securing space communication assets and contributing towards the resilience of India's space ecosystem. The guideline document was released during the DefSat Conference & Expo- 2026 held at New Delhi from 24-26 February 2026.\n\nThese guidelines are advisory in nature and are intended to advance cyber security preparedness across the space sector. The framework has been thoughtfully designed to support the diverse stakeholders of the space ecosystem, including government agencies, satellite service providers, ground station operators, equipment vendors, and private space enterprises. By articulating essential cyber security principles, recommended controls, and clearly defined responsibilities, the guidelines seek to foster a culture of resilience, accountability, and proactive risk management throughout the sector.\n\nDr. Sanjay Bahl, Director General, CERT-In said “CERT-In remains steadfast in strengthening the cyber resilience of all sectors across Bharat. Recognizing the strategic importance of space systems, including satellite communication networks, to India’s technological sovereignty and future growth, these comprehensive guidelines establish a unified and forward-looking framework by considering defense in depth, breadth and height to safeguard satellite networks, ground infrastructure, space related supply chains and space assets against the rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated cyber threat landscape.”\n\nDr. Subba Rao Pavuluri, President, SIA-India, said “Public Private Partnership and the considered views of industry are fundamental to strengthening cyber resilience across any sector. This joint guideline document issued by CERT-In and SIA India reflect a holistic and collaborative approach, integrating industry perspectives with the deep cyber security expertise of CERT-In. Together, they mark a significant step forward in advancing the cyber security posture of India’s space sector and reinforcing its preparedness against emerging digital threats.”\n\nMr. Anil Prakash, Director General, SIA-India, underscored “\n“India’s expanding space ecosystem now requires cybersecurity to evolve from a technical afterthought into a core pillar of mission assurance. The joint framework developed with CERT-In institutionalizes resilience across satellites, ground infrastructure, and supply chains—particularly significant at a time when over 1.5 million cyberattack attempts were recorded during Operation Sindoor and attacks on government networks surged nearly sevenfold. In this evolving threat landscape, critical infrastructure and industry are equally vulnerable. Importantly, these cyber guidelines are based on an adaptive model and will be periodically refined through structured industry consultation to remain responsive to emerging threats and technological advancements. For industry, this is a clear call to adopt secure-by-design architectures and align innovation with national security imperatives.”\n\nAbout CERT-In:\n\nThe Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India has been designated to serve as National agency for incident response under Section 70B of the Information Technology Act, 2000. CERT-In operates a 24x7 incident response Help Desk for providing timely response to reported cyber security incidents. CERT-In provides Incident Prevention and Response services as well as Security Quality Management Services.\n\nAbout SIA-India:\n\nSIA-India is a non-profit organization representing the interests of the space industry in India. SIA-India membership includes satellite operators, manufacturers, suppliers, startups, academic institutions, and law firms. The association is committed to serve as a voice for the industry and represent the industry's interests at policy making and regulatory bodies. SIA-India also offers a platform to forge international collaborations and provides an interface with the government.\n\nThe Guideline is available at:\n\nhttps://www.cert-in.org.in/s2cMainServlet?pageid=GUIDLNVIEW02&refcode=CISG-2026-01\n\n****\n\nMSZ\n\n(Release ID: 2233122)\n\nVisitor Counter : 398\n\nRead this release in:\n\nUrdu\n\n,\n\nMarathi\n\n,\n\nहिन्दी\n\n,\n\nTamil\n\n,\n\nTelugu\n\nMinistry of Electronics & IT\n\nIndia’s Space Ecosystem Gets Cyber Shield as SIA-India, CERT-In Release Joint Guidelines\n\nPosted On:\n26 FEB 2026 4:55PM by PIB Delhi\n\nSpace cyber security, including Satellite Communication systems, is of paramount importance to India’s space architecture.
