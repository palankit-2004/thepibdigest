As part of the launch, the SIM framework for Tripura was outlined, including the institutionalization of SIM under the Tripura Institution for Transformation (TIFT), the inauguration of T-NEST (Tripura – Nurturing Entrepreneurship and Startups) as a dedicated incubation and innovation facility to incubate startups and promote “Make from Tripura” solutions; along with the creation of Innovation Centres in each of the 8 district linked to T-NEST to promote innovation among women and tribal communities.\n\nProf. (Dr.) Manik Saha, also launched of one of India’s first District Innovator Fellowships (DIF) to identify and nurture grassroots innovators with structured lifecycle support and announced that Tripura would come out with a State AI Policy aligned with the Hon’ble Prime Minister’s vision of responsible and inclusive AI along with the creation of one of its kind AI City in Agartala with support from leading global technology enablers, positioning the State as a future-ready hub for AI-driven innovation and governance.\n\nThrough the State Innovation Mission, AIM will work closely with the Government of Tripura to support the design and implementation of a long-term innovation and entrepreneurship strategy, aligned with the State’s economic priorities, sectoral strengths, and development goals.

He observed that the transition from the Planning Commission to NITI Aayog, coupled with the creation of AIM, marked a shift from traditional planning to innovation-led development, empowering States to become active drivers of growth. Referring to Tripura, he said the launch of the SIM reflects how States can effectively leverage the AIM framework to unlock local potential and position themselves as emerging engines of national growth.\n\nDeepak Bagla, Mission Director, Atal Innovation Mission, NITI Aayog, highlighted AIM’s approach to strengthening State-led innovation systems:\n\n\"The Hon’ble Prime Minister vision is to build an innovation-led Aatmanirbharat. The State Innovation Mission is our endeavor to that vision. By empowering States to lead innovation in their own context, we are ensuring that talent from every district, every classroom, and every community becomes a driver of national growth. This is how AIM is working to transform aspiration into action and ensure that India’s innovation journey is truly inclusive.\"\n\nThe State Innovation Mission will also support Tripura in strengthening innovation education and entrepreneurial exposure from the school level onwards, while enabling startups and innovators to access infrastructure, mentorship, and funding support beyond traditional risk thresholds. The Mission places strong emphasis on inclusion, regional balance, and collaboration between government, academia, industry, and civil society.\n\nThe launch of SIM in Tripura builds on AIM’s sustained engagement with the State over the past year and reflects AIM’s broader commitment to working with States and Union Territories as key partners in achieving the national vision of Viksit Bharat 2047 through innovation-led development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n****\n\nMJPS/PKK\n\n(Release ID: 2233156)\n\nVisitor Counter : 202\n\nRead this release in:\n\nहिन्दी\n\nNITI Aayog\n\nAtal Innovation Mission launches the first State Innovation Mission (SIM) in Tripura to strengthen State-led innovation ecosystem\n\nHon’ble CM Tripura outlines Tripura’s vision for innovation-led growth under SIM\nAIM has delivered tangible outcomes over the past decade and shaped India’s innovation roadmap: Dr. Jitendra Singh\n\nPosted On:\n26 FEB 2026 5:41PM by PIB Delhi\n\nAtal Innovation Mission (AIM), under NITI Aayog, today launched the first State Innovation Mission (SIM) in Tripura, marking a significant step towards embedding Innovation and Entrepreneurship into the State’s long-term development framework.\n\nThe State Innovation Mission is part of the approved AIM 2.0 programme, under the aegis of NITI Aayog’s State Support Mission (SSM), and is designed as a long-term institutional mechanism to support States and Union Territories in building robust, inclusive, and context-specific innovation ecosystems aligned with national priorities and local strengths.\n\nThe launch event was held at the Hapania International Exhibition Centre in Agartala in the presence of Prof. (Dr.) Manik Saha, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Tripura; Shri Suman Bery, Hon’ble Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog; Jitendra Singh, Hon’ble Union Minister of State and Dr VK Saraswat, Hon’ble Member, NITI Aayog.\n\nHon’ble Chief Minister of Tripura, Prof. (Dr.) Manik Saha, while addressing the gathering, announced a slew of forward-looking initiatives under the State Innovation Mission.
