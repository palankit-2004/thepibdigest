So far, 9 Divisions have entered into MoUs with concerned Army organizations for hiring of Pointsmen.\n\nThe collaborative framework also calls upon Army recruiting organizations to proactively engage with Railway Divisions to expedite the filling of these posts.\n\nHarnessing Collective Strengths for Nation Building\n\nIndian Railways and Indian Army share valuable skills, discipline, technical competence and leadership qualities developed during service, contributing significantly to nation building. A substantial number of soldiers retire at a comparatively young age with rich operational and managerial experience, along with strong discipline and national fervour.\n\nThe cooperation between Indian Railways and Indian Army plays a vital role in logistics and personnel movement. Strategic infrastructure projects such as the Dedicated Freight Corridors and the Udhampur–Srinagar–Baramulla Rail Link have enhanced rapid deployment capabilities for troops and equipment. Skill-sharing initiatives are also being promoted through Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya.\n\nThe framework promotes structured engagement of ex-servicemen and ex-agniveers within the existing recruitment system and strengthens long-term collaboration. The initiative underscores the Government’s commitment to leveraging the experience and discipline of armed forces veterans while strengthening national infrastructure and security coordination.\n\n *****\n\nDharmendra Tewari/ Ritu Raj\n\n(Release ID: 2233196)\n\nVisitor Counter : 236\n\nRead this release in:\n\nUrdu\n\n,\n\nMarathi\n\n,\n\nहिन्दी\n\n,\n\nGujarati\n\n,\n\nTamil\n\n,\n\nKannada\n\n,\n\nMalayalam\n\nMinistry of Railways\n\nIndian Railways and Indian Army Launch ‘Framework of Cooperation’ to Strengthen Post-Retirement Career Opportunities for Agniveers and Serving Army Personnel\n\nMajor Employment Push with Dedicated Reservation for Ex-Servicemen and Ex-Agniveers in Level-1 and Level-2/Above Posts\nRailways to Recruit Over 5,000 Ex-Servicemen as Pointsmen on Contract Basis to Fill Vacancies Faster\nRailways Reserved 14,788 Posts for Ex-Servicemen in 2024–25 Vacancy Notifications\n\nPosted On:\n26 FEB 2026 6:48PM by PIB Delhi\n\nIn a significant step towards deepening institutional collaboration, Indian Railways and the Indian Army have introduced a “Framework of Cooperation” aimed at expanding post-retirement employment opportunities for Agniveers and serving Army personnel transitioning to civilian life.\n\nSpearheaded by senior leadership from the Army and the Ministry of Railways, the initiative is designed to ensure a smoother shift from military to civilian careers.
