Lyonpo Gem Tshering, Hon’ble Minister for Energy and Natural Resources.\n\nThe Secretary, DoWR, RD & GR, MoJS, GoI, also visited the Punatsangchhu-I Hydro Electric Project under construction and the recently commissioned Punatsangchhu-II Hydroelectric Project in Bhutan on 26 February 2026.

Other site visits included the National Center for Hydrology and Meteorology (NCHM), Bhutan, in Thimphu; the 3.5 MLD Water Treatment Plant at Chamgang; and the NCHM flood monitoring station near Wangdue Phodrang Dzong.\n\nThe visit aimed to enhance water resources management, flood forecasting, and climate resilience in shared river basins. It reaffirmed the shared commitment of both countries to the sustainable and mutually beneficial management of trans-boundary water resources. The Secretary, DoWR, RD & GR, GoI, conveyed India’s continued support for deepening cooperation in water resources management.\n\nMeeting with Minister, MoNER, RGOB\n\nBilateral Meeting Photo\n\nVisit to NCHM, Thimphu\n\nGroup photo at NCHM, Thimphu\n\nVisit to 3.5 MLD Water Treatment Plant\n\nVisit to NCHM Flood Monitoring Station Near Wangdue Phodrang Dzong\n\nReview of Puna-2 & Puna-1 at Kamechu Conference Hall\n\nVisit to Punatsangchhu-1 HEP\n\n*******\n\nND\n\n(Release ID: 2233399)\n\nVisitor Counter : 616\n\nRead this release in:\n\nUrdu\n\n,\n\nहिन्दी\n\n,\n\nBengali\n\n,\n\nTamil\n\nMinistry of Jal Shakti\n\nIndia–Bhutan Deepen Bilateral Cooperation on Trans-Boundary Rivers and Hydropower Projects\n\nSecretary, DoWR, RD & GR Reviews Hydropower Projects; Explores Enhanced Flood Forecasting and Data Sharing Mechanisms\n\nPosted On:\n27 FEB 2026 11:58AM by PIB Delhi\n\nShri V.
