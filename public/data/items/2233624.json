Recalling earlier student exchange initiatives, particularly those involving youth from the North-East, he shared how such programmes helped remove hesitation and build confidence among students from remote regions. He narrated an instance where festivals such as Lohri, Bihu, Makar Sankranti and Pongal were celebrated together, enabling students to realise that while traditions may differ, the spirit of celebration across India remains the same, strengthening emotional unity.\n\nWhile interacting with students, the Minister said that in today’s era, technology has effectively removed geographical barriers and eliminated the notion of “small places.” With digital access and expanding infrastructure, students can now prepare for Civil Services and pursue competitive careers from any corner of the country. He encouraged the youth to first understand their inner capacity and strengths before deciding their path, emphasising that clarity of self is the foundation of success.\n\nReferring to the last decade of governance under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Dr Jitendra Singh said that numerous schemes and initiatives have opened new avenues for young people to progress in diverse sectors. He assured the students that government support is available to all those who are determined to work hard and move forward.\n\nSpeaking about Ladakh’s rapid transformation, he mentioned the establishment of new colleges, expansion of higher education institutions, and the opening of engineering, medical and civil services avenues in recent years. He also referred to the Prime Minister’s multiple visits to Ladakh, including one during extreme winter conditions, describing it as a reflection of deep commitment toward the region and its people.\n\nThe visiting students were delegates of the Student Experience in Regional Understanding (SERU). The programme aims to promote cultural understanding, national integration, and academic exposure by facilitating interaction among students from different regions of India.\n\nDuring the interaction, a student delegate recalled that in the early 1990s, students from states including Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi had visited Ladakh under similar programmes. Although the initiative experienced interruptions, it has now been revived in a structured manner.\n\nLast year, 20 students from different districts of Ladakh participated in the programme, travelling to various states, interacting with diverse personalities, and visiting leading educational institutions where they met Vice Chancellors and faculty members. This year, the participation has expanded to 30 students representing newly formed districts and border regions such as Kargil, Nubra and Changthang, ensuring broader representation from across Ladakh.\n\nStudents described the experience as enriching and confidence-building, stating that exposure to different academic environments and cultural settings has widened their aspirations and strengthened their sense of belonging to a larger national community.\n\n*****\n\n\n\nNKR/AK\n\n(Release ID: 2233624)\n\nVisitor Counter : 50\n\nRead this release in:\n\nUrdu\n\nMinistry of Science & Technology\n\nUnion Minister Dr Jitendra Singh Hosts Luncheon interaction for Ladakh students; Appreciates their aspirational urge; Encourages them to Recognise Their Potential and Leverage National Opportunities\n\nTechnology Has Ended the Concept of ‘Small Places’; Recognise Your Inner Potential and Seize National Opportunities: Dr Jitendra Singh to Ladakh Students\nPrime Minister’s Vision, Government Support and Exposure Creating New Pathways for Youth: Dr Jitendra Singh\n\nPosted On:\n27 FEB 2026 6:16PM by PIB Delhi\n\nUnion Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences, and MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh hosted a delegation of students from Ladakh at his residence for a special luncheon interaction, appreciated their amazing aspirational urge and engaged them in an open and inspiring conversation on youth empowerment, national integration, and emerging opportunities.\n\nInteracting warmly with the students, Dr Jitendra Singh spoke about the transformative role of exposure and cultural exchange in shaping young minds.
