  "text": "Press Release:Press Information Bureau\n\nMinistry of Health and Family Welfare\n\nPrime Minister to Launch Nationwide HPV Vaccination Drive for 14-Year-Old Girls from Ajmer Tomorrow\n\nA Major Leap Towards Eliminating Cervical Cancer and Advancing the Vision of ‘Swastha Nari’\n\nPosted On:\n27 FEB 2026 6:26PM by PIB Delhi\n\nIn a landmark step towards strengthening preventive healthcare and safeguarding the future health of India’s daughters, Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will launch the nationwide Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination Programme for girls aged 14 years tomorrow at 11:30 AM from Ajmer, Rajasthan.\n\nThe nationwide rollout marks a decisive move in India’s public health journey and fulfils the Government’s commitment to advancing the vision of “Swastha Nari” – ensuring prevention, protection and equity at the core of women’s healthcare.\n\nThe programme will target approximately 1.15 crore girls aged 14 years every year across all States and Union Territories. The vaccine will be provided free of cost at designated Government health facilities. Vaccination will be conducted at Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (Primary Health Centres), Community Health Centres, Sub-District and District Hospitals as well as Government Medical Colleges and Hospitals.\n\nEach session will be supervised by trained Medical Officers, supported by skilled healthcare teams. All sites will have functional Cold Chain Points (CCPs) and will be linked to 24×7 government health facilities to ensure immediate medical support and management of any rare Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI).\n\nVaccination will be voluntary and informed consent from parents/guardians will be obtained prior to administration.\n\nThe special campaign will run in mission mode over a three-month period, during which eligible girls can receive the vaccine daily at designated facilities. Thereafter, the vaccine will continue to be available on routine immunization days.\n\nBackground:\n\nCervical cancer remains the second most common cancer among women in India, with over 1 lakh 20 thousand new cases and nearly 80 thousand deaths annually as per the GLOBOCAN 2022 data. Scientific evidence establishes that almost all cases are caused by persistent infection with high-risk types of Human Papillomavirus (HPV), particularly types 16 and 18, which account for more than 80% of cervical cancer cases in India.\n\nDespite being largely preventable through vaccination and early screening, cervical cancer continues to impose a heavy burden on families and the healthcare system. The nationwide HPV vaccination programme directly addresses this challenge by preventing HPV infection before it can progress to cancer.\n\nIndia’s national programme will use Gardasil, a quadrivalent HPV vaccine that protects against HPV types 16 and 18 (which cause cervical cancer), as well as types 6 and 11.\n\nHPV vaccines are among the most extensively studied vaccines globally with more than 500 million doses administered worldwide since 2006. Scientific evidence demonstrates 93–100% effectiveness in preventing cervical cancer caused by vaccine-covered HPV types.\n\nIn June 2022, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization of the World Health Organization concluded that a single-dose schedule provides protection comparable to two-dose schedules. The December 2022 WHO Position Paper further endorsed single-dose schedules as an effective and programmatically advantageous option for girls aged 9–20 years.\n\nIndia’s approach aligns with these global recommendations and the expert guidance of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI).\n\nWith this launch, India will join over 160 countries that have introduced HPV vaccination into their immunization schedules. More than 90 countries are implementing single-dose HPV vaccination schedules, improving coverage, affordability, and programme efficiency.\n\nSeveral countries have already reported substantial reductions in HPV infection rates, precancerous lesions, and cervical cancer incidence following widespread vaccination.\n\nTo ensure uninterrupted supply and uncompromised quality, the Government of India has secured HPV vaccine supplies through a transparent and globally supported procurement mechanism in partnership with GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance. The vaccines used in the national programme are approved by India’s drug regulator and meet stringent quality and cold-chain standards.\n\nAdequate vaccine doses, commensurate with the target cohort of each State and UT, have already been supplied and States/UTs have been trained for seamless rollout and last-mile distribution.\n\nDuring the launch event in Ajmer, all States and Union Territories will join virtually in coordination with their respective NIC units. Hon’ble Chief Ministers, Administrators, State Health Ministers, and senior health officials will participate from their State/UT headquarters. Following the national launch, States/UTs will proceed with their own HPV vaccination launch events on the same day.\n\nThe nationwide HPV vaccination programme reflects delivery-oriented governance where scientific evidence, policy commitment and implementation readiness converge to produce measurable public health impact.\n\nThe Union Health Ministry urges parents and guardians to ensure that their 14-year-old daughters receive the HPV vaccine once the programme is rolled out.\n\nHPV vaccination is a powerful preventive step that can save lives. By choosing vaccination, families can secure a healthier, cancer-free future for India’s daughters.\n\n***\n\nSR\n\n(Release ID: 2233632)\n\nVisitor Counter : 529\n\nRead this release in:\n\nUrdu\n\n,\n\nहिन्दी\n\nMinistry of Health and Family Welfare\n\nPrime Minister to Launch Nationwide HPV Vaccination Drive for 14-Year-Old Girls from Ajmer Tomorrow\n\nA Major Leap Towards Eliminating Cervical Cancer and Advancing the Vision of ‘Swastha Nari’\n\nPosted On:\n27 FEB 2026 6:26PM by PIB Delhi\n\nIn a landmark step towards strengthening preventive healthcare and safeguarding the future health of India’s daughters, Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will launch the nationwide Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination Programme for girls aged 14 years tomorrow at 11:30 AM from Ajmer, Rajasthan.\n\nThe nationwide rollout marks a decisive move in India’s public health journey and fulfils the Government’s commitment to advancing the vision of “Swastha Nari” – ensuring prevention, protection and equity at the core of women’s healthcare.\n\nThe programme will target approximately 1.15 crore girls aged 14 years every year across all States and Union Territories.
