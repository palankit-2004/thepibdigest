Radhakrishnan Presides Over 57th Convocation of IIMC; Lays Foundation Stone for New Academic Block\n\nAt Convocation, Vice President Calls for Truth-Centred Journalism\nAshwini Vaishnaw Announces Journalist Fellowship, Urges Graduates to Contribute to a Developed India\n\nPosted On:\n27 FEB 2026 8:50PM by PIB Delhi\n\nThe 57th Convocation Ceremony of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC), Deemed to be University, was held today at its New Delhi campus. This is the first convocation of a batch graduating after IIMC attained deemed-to-be-university status in January 2024.\n\nThe Hon’ble Vice President of India graced the occasion and laid the foundation stone for a new academic block, marking a major infrastructure expansion at the institute.\n\nAddressing the 57th Convocation Ceremony of Indian Institute of Mass Communication, the Vice President of India, Shri C. P. Radhakrishnan, said that journalism must not ignore challenges, but it must equally highlight progress and nation-building efforts. Speaking to graduating students of Journalism, Advertising and Public Relations, he noted that communicators shape aspirations, amplify national priorities and craft narratives that inspire progress. He emphasized that creativity is not merely a commercial tool, but a catalyst for transformation and social change. The Vice President underlined that while technology, platforms and mediums will continue to evolve, the core values of journalism and communication accuracy, fairness, integrity and accountability must remain non-negotiable. He urged graduates to uphold purpose-driven communication and contribute towards building a confident and inclusive India.\n\nAddressing the gathering, Union Minister for Information & Broadcasting, Electronics & IT and Railways, Shri Ashwini Vaishnaw, said IIMC is one of India’s premier institutions with a high placement rate and graduates widely sought after in the media industry.\n\nHe announced that from the next academic session, IIMC will introduce a Fellowship Programme for journalists to enable specialization in areas such as technology, economy and strategy, enhancing research and domain expertise. The Minister also highlighted the establishment of an incubator at IIMC and appreciated innovative startups, including one transforming Indian folk tales into technology-driven storytelling formats. He further underlined the importance of\nGen Bharat\n in shaping India’s future trajectory.\n\n'Gen Bharat' - आप बनाएंगे विकसित भारत, जो कि आज हमारा राष्ट्रीय संकल्प है।🇮🇳\n📍57th Convocation, IIMC, New Delhi\npic.twitter.com/d4Llj4Zrwq\n— Ashwini Vaishnaw (@AshwiniVaishnaw)\nFebruary 27, 2026\n\nAt the ceremony, 509 students from nine PG Diploma programmes across six campuses were awarded diplomas.
