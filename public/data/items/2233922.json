He said India is now firmly on course to become the third largest economy in the near future and achieve the goal of Viksit Bharat by 2047.\n\nDelivering the  P. Parameswaran Memorial Lecture on the theme “Viksit Bharat @2047: Science, Technology and Future Ready Innovation for National Transformation” at Kowdiar, Thiruvananthapuram, Dr. Jitendra Singh described the occasion as providential, as the lecture coincided with National Science Day. The programme was organised by “Bharatheeya Vichara Kendram” in memory of Shri P. Parameswaran, the renowned thinker, ideologue, and social leader.\n\nBeginning his address with a reflection on India’s civilizational journey, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that India is an ancient civilization that has survived invasions, colonial rule,and systemic exploitation, yet has emerged stronger with renewed self-belief. He said that the real spirit of democracy has deepened in recent years, empowering even the most underprivileged citizen to aspire without barriers.\n\nHe said democracy becomes meaningful when even a mother in the poorest household can dream that her child can become a scientist, doctor, or civil servant, and believe that the system will allow that dream to be realised.\n\nIn the field of innovation, he said that in 2014 India ranked 81st in the Global Innovation Index and has since climbed to 38th position. The country now has over two lakh startups generating more than 21 lakh jobs. He recalled that when “Start Up India” was announced in 2015, the concept was unfamiliar to many; today it has evolved into a nationwide movement. Nearly half of these startups are emerging from Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, and a significant share are women-led enterprises.\n\nHe said that the conventional discourse on women empowerment is undergoing a shift, as women scientists and innovators are leading some of the country’s most prestigious national missions in space, science and governance.\n\nOn research output, Dr. Jitendra Singh said India ranks sixth globally in patent filings, with more than 60 percent filed by resident Indians. The country is among the top nations in scientific publications, with a growing number of highly cited research papers. Thousands of Indian scientists feature among the top two percent globally, reflecting the global recognition of Indian scientific talent.\n\nSpeaking about space and nuclear sectors, the Minister said that policy reforms have opened new avenues for private participation, resulting in a sharp expansion of India’s space economy. Indigenous capabilities in defence and advanced technologies have also grown significantly, with rising exports and increasing self-reliance.\n\nDr. Jitendra Singh referred to the Ocean Mission and said India is uniquely placed, being the only country with an ocean named after it. He said the exploration of marine resources, deep-sea minerals and biodiversity will play a major role in future value addition to the national economy.\n\nHe also spoke about policy initiatives such as the National Education Policy 2020, Atal Innovation Mission, PM Mudra Yojana, PM Vishwakarma Yojana and PM SVANidhi, which are expanding opportunities beyond conventional government employment. These measures, he said, are encouraging entrepreneurship, supporting traditional artisans, and enabling street vendors and small entrepreneurs to gain dignity and economic stability.\n\nCalling this “the best time to be in India,” Dr. Jitendra Singh urged young Indians, including those pursuing higher studies abroad, to remain connected with the nation’s growth story. He said that while global exposure is valuable, India today offers unprecedented opportunities in research, innovation,and enterprise.\n\nConcluding his address, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that Viksit Bharat in 2047 will be shaped by the youth of today. The responsibility of the present generation, he said, is to build capacity, strengthen institutions and create an enabling ecosystem so that when India celebrates 100 years of independence, it stands as a fully developed, innovation-driven and globally respected nation.\n\nUnion Minister Dr. Jitendra Singh delivering Keynote address on the theme “Viksit Bharat 2047” during 5th P.
