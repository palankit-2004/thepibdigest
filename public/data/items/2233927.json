Sood, while chairing the National Science Day Lectures at the National Science Day Celebration–2026 held at Plenary Hall, Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi.\n\nThe celebration, organised under the focal theme “Women in Science Catalysing Viksit Bharat,” featured three National Science Day Lectures followed by a panel discussion on Science Policy Interface for Catalysing Viksit Bharat. The event brought together policymakers, scientists, researchers and academicians to deliberate on strengthening India’s scientific ecosystem in alignment with national development priorities.\n\nIn his address, Prof. Ajay K. Sood emphasized that India’s scientific advancement must be closely aligned with policy direction and national missions. He underlined that sectors such as aerospace, defence, critical metals, advanced materials and digital communication require coordinated institutional mechanisms and sustained research investment. He stressed that the science-policy interface plays a decisive role in translating scientific capabilities into national strength.\n\nThe PSA highlighted the need for integrated approaches in emerging and strategic domains, noting that research, innovation and policy frameworks must function in synergy. He underscored that future growth will depend on building indigenous technological capacity, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and ensuring that research outcomes are effectively deployed for societal benefit. Prof. Sood also emphasized the importance of communicating science in Indian languages to enhance public engagement and inclusive outreach.\n\nThe National Science Day Lectures included presentations on Made in India technologies for Aerospace and Defence, Roadmap and Solutions for Critical Metals and Materials: An Integrated Approach, and Direct to Mobile Broadcasting. The deliberations highlighted the importance of technological self-reliance and long-term strategic planning in critical sectors.\n\nProf. Abhay Karandikar, Secretary, Department of Science and Technology (DST), in his address, emphasized that India’s science policy architecture must support both frontier research and translational innovation. He highlighted DST’s commitment to enabling interdisciplinary research, strengthening institutional collaborations and building capacity in emerging technologies. He noted that science-led development must ensure that research outcomes move efficiently from laboratories to real-world applications.\n\nProf. Karandikar further stressed that empowering researchers, particularly women in science, and building inclusive research ecosystems are essential for sustained national progress. He underlined that policy instruments must accelerate innovation cycles while ensuring equitable access to scientific advancements across sectors and regions.\n\nProf. Shekhar C. Mande, President, Indian National Science Academy (INSA), during the panel discussion, emphasized the importance of sustained dialogue between scientists and policymakers. He highlighted that evidence-based policymaking must be informed by scientific expertise and rigorous research. He noted that strengthening institutional interfaces between academia and government will be critical for catalyzing Viksit Bharat.\n\nShri Shashi S. Vempati, Former CEO, Prasar Bharati, delivered a lecture on “Direct to Mobile Broadcasting: India’s Next Digital Leapfrog.” He described Doordarshan’s journey across different information and communication technology phases, leading towards direct-to-mobile broadcasting in collaboration with IIT Kanpur and a startup partner.\n\nDr. K. Balasubramanian, Director, Non-Ferrous Technology Development Centre (NFTDC), delivered a lecture titled “Roadmap & Solutions for Critical Metals: An Integrated Approach.” He highlighted India’s strengths in process engineering, information technology, and rapid plant-scale capability. He noted that with access to raw materials, operational capacity can be developed in a short time. He called for a shift from serial lab-to-plant development to a mission-mode, systems-based approach in strategic non-ferrous metals relevant to space, defence, and nuclear sectors.\n\nDr. Shubha V. Iyenger, Former Distinguished Scientist, CSIR–National Aerospace Laboratories (CSIR-NAL), delivered a lecture on “Made in India Technologies for Aerospace and Defence,” highlighting “Drishti,” India’s first indigenous runway visibility measuring system. She was conferred the Padma Shri in 2026 for developing Drishti.\n\nThe event concluded with a collective resolve to deepen science–policy integration, strengthen institutional collaboration and enhance public engagement with science as India advances towards its long-term development goals.\n\n****\n\nNKR/FK/NM\n\n(Release ID: 2233927)\n\nVisitor Counter : 79\n\nRead this release in:\n\nUrdu\n\n,\n\nहिन्दी\n\n,\n\nTamil\n\nMinistry of Science & Technology\n\nScience leaders discuss efficient ways to convert research outcomes to real-world applications\n\nPosted On:\n28 FEB 2026 4:29PM by PIB Delhi\n\nScience–policy convergence is essential to realise the vision of Viksit Bharat, said Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA) to the Government of India, Prof. Ajay K.
