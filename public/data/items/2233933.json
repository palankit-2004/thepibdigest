Discussions also focused on enhancing the performance of AMCs and MDMCs and promoting a culture of systematic reporting in healthcare institutions.\n\nThe second day of the meet was devoted to structured working group deliberations under the theme “Empowering India’s Pharmacovigilance and Materiovigilance: From Awareness to Action.”\nAlong with\n the technical sessions,\nt\nhe working groups examined strategies to address underreporting, develop standardised frameworks for documentation and analysis of preventable adverse events, and expand pharmacovigilance and materiovigilance outreach beyond district-level healthcare facilities.\n\nThe recommendations emerging from the deliberations emphasised capacity building, standardisation of reporting practices, improved inter-institutional coordination, and integration of technology-enabled monitoring mechanisms to strengthen patient safety.\n\nThe meet concluded with a reaffirmation of IPC’s commitment to further strengthening India’s pharmacovigilance and materiovigilance ecosystem through coordinated and evidence-based interventions.\n\n****\n\nSR\n\nHFW\n/\nIPC and AMTZ Host National Meet to Strengthen India’s Pharmacovigilance & Materiovigilance Systems /28\nth\n February 2026/2\n\n(Release ID: 2233933)\n\nVisitor Counter : 195\n\nRead this release in:\n\nUrdu\n\n,\n\nहिन्दी\n\n,\n\nTamil\n\nMinistry of Health and Family Welfare\n\nIndian Pharmacopoeia Commission (IPC) and Andhra Pradesh MedTech Zone (AMTZ) Organise National Meet on Strengthening Pharmacovigilance and Materiovigilance in India at Visakhapatnam\n\nFirst-Ever National Annual Meet of PvPI and MvPI Regional Centres to Strengthen India’s Drug and Medical Device Safety Framework and Institutional Coordination\nADR PvPI 2.0 Mobile Application Launched during the Meet to Enhance Real-Time Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting and Patient Safety Across India\nFrom Awareness to Action: National Meet Drives Coordinated, Technology-Enabled Transformation of Drug and Medical Device Safety and Patient Protection in India\n\nPosted On:\n28 FEB 2026 4:39PM by PIB Delhi\n\nThe Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission (IPC), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, in collaboration with the Andhra Pradesh MedTech Zone (AMTZ) organised a two-day National Meet on Strengthening Pharmacovigilance and Materiovigilance in India on 27-28 February 2026 at Andhra Pradesh MedTech Zone (AMTZ), Visakhapatnam.  In a first-time ever national meet, the 1\nst\n Annual Meeting of Regional Centres participating in the Pharmacovigilance Programme of India (PvPI) and the Materiovigilance Programme of India (MvPI) was organised to strengthen India’s drug and medical device safety systems and enhance coordination among regulators, healthcare institutions, ADR Monitoring Centres (AMCs), and Medical Device Monitoring Centres (MDMCs).
