The review focused on ensuring passenger safety, operational continuity and real-time coordination in light of multiple airspace restrictions and NOTAMs issued in parts of the region.\n\nIndian carriers operating international services have been advised to continuously monitor airspace advisories, NOTAMs, and route restrictions issued by the concerned authorities. Airlines have been directed to ensure timely rerouting or diversion of flights, wherever required, strictly in accordance with global safety protocols and established contingency planning procedures.\n\nAirports across the country, particularly major international gateways, have been placed on operational alert to manage potential flight diversions, unscheduled landings and passenger facilitation requirements. The Airports Authority of India and private airport operators have been advised to maintain enhanced coordination with airlines for ground handling, parking bays, passenger amenities, crew logistics and immigration support, as necessary.\n\nThe Directorate General of Civil Aviation has been advised to remain in close coordination with airlines to ensure full compliance with safety regulations, crew duty time limitations, and operational advisories. Further, continuous monitoring mechanisms should be activated to assess the evolving airspace dynamics and mitigate any cascading impact on domestic schedules.\n\nThe Ministry is also in close touch with the Ministry of External Affairs to ensure seamless information flow and appropriate coordination in case of any emergent requirements involving Indian carriers or Indian nationals abroad.\n\nPassengers are advised to stay in regular contact with their respective airlines for updated travel information and schedule changes. Airlines have been instructed to proactively communicate with passengers regarding delays, rerouting, or diversions to minimize inconvenience.\n\nThe safety of passengers and crew remains paramount. The Ministry of Civil Aviation is closely monitoring the situation to ensure safe, orderly, and efficient air operations.\n\nThe situation is under constant watch.
