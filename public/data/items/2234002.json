The programme deliberated on preparing a roadmap for Kerala’s development over the next decade up to 2036 and aligning it with the broader Vision Bharat goals.\n\nDr Jitendra Singh said Kerala stands at a decisive moment where its strengths in education, scientific aptitude, coastal resources, and skilled human capital can be effectively harnessed for accelerated and inclusive growth. He said the coming decade presents an opportunity to integrate Kerala’s development priorities with national missions in science, technology, and the blue economy.\n\nReferring to the Centre’s commitment towards Keralam, the Minister said that in the very first Cabinet meeting held at the newly developed Seva Teerth, the Modi Government took the decision to officially adopt the name “Keralam” in place of “Kerala”, reflecting respect for the State’s cultural and linguistic identity. He said the decision symbolised sensitivity towards Kerala’s heritage and aspirations.\n\nHe further said that successive Union Budgets have made specific provisions for strengthening coastal infrastructure, promoting the fisheries sector, and expanding livelihood opportunities in maritime States like Keralam. Dedicated allocations for coastal area development, marine resources, and blue economy initiatives, including the Deep Ocean Mission, are expected to unlock new growth avenues for Kerala’s long coastline and fishing communities.\n\nThe Minister said that coastal States like Keralam are uniquely positioned to benefit from science-led marine exploration and sustainable ocean resource management. He added that effective coordination between the Centre and the State can significantly enhance the pace of development, ensuring that policies and programmes move forward with greater momentum and efficiency.\n\nDr Jitendra Singh said that while several Central schemes are designed to benefit citizens across sectors, their full impact depends on seamless implementation and constructive cooperation across levels of governance. He said that when development priorities of the State move in harmony with the national vision, progress can gather “double engine” momentum, ultimately benefiting the common citizen.\n\nFormer Union Minister Shri Muralidharan, in his remarks, said that successive governments in the State have not adequately prioritised the basic needs of common citizens. Referring to concerns in sectors such as healthcare, he said services, particularly for economically weaker sections, require greater accountability and responsiveness. He said the time has come to create awareness among citizens about governance models that ensure responsibility and closer alignment with the Government of India for the State’s long-term benefit.\n\nDr Jitendra Singh expressed confidence that with a clear roadmap, accountable governance and coordinated efforts, Kerala can move ahead at an accelerated pace and contribute significantly to India’s journey towards becoming a developed nation.\n\n*****\n\nAK\n\n(Release ID: 2234002)\n\nVisitor Counter : 27\n\nMinistry of Science & Technology\n\n‘Double Engine’ Momentum Can Fast-Track Kerala’s Progress; State’s Next Decade Crucial to India’s Development Vision: Dr Jitendra Singh\n\nFrom ‘Kerala’ to ‘Keralam’, Modi Government Signals Commitment; Coordinated Governance Essential for Development, says Dr Jitendra Singh in Thiruvananthapuram\nCoastal Infrastructure, Fisheries Support and Accountable Governance Key to Strengthening Kerala’s Economy: Dr Jitendra Singh\n\nPosted On:\n28 FEB 2026 7:04PM by PIB Delhi\n\nUnion Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences, and MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh addressed a programme organised by the Institute of Engineers along with several NGOs under the leadership of former Union Minister Shri Muralidharan.
