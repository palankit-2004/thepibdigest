  "text": "Press Release:Press Information Bureau\n\nPIB Headquarters\n\nStrengthening Allied Sector and Market Access\n\nTransforming India’s Livestock and Fisheries Sector\n\nPosted On:\n01 MAR 2026 10:43AM by PIB Delhi\n\nIntroduction\n\nIndia’s agricultural progress is increasingly supported by the expansion of\nallied sectors\n such as\nlivestock, dairy, poultry, and fisheries\n. These sectors have become major contributors to agricultural\nGross Value Added (GVA)\n and\nrural employment\n. Over the last decade,\nagriculture and allied\n sectors have witnessed a\nsteady 3-5% CAGR\n, fuelled by extensive government efforts, private innovations, and sizeable domestic demand. It is estimated that by\n2047\n, the sector could potentially triple in size, powering India’s growth.\n\nAlthough rural livelihoods remain largely agriculture-based, changes in\nland use, climate variability,\nand\n income uncertainty\nhave encouraged households to adopt additional income sources. For small and marginal farmers, diversification has become an important way to manage\nseasonal income fluctuations\nand ensure more\n stable earnings.\n\nDiversification includes income from\nfarm, allied,\nand\n non-farm activities\n to reduce risk and smooth household consumption. Rather than moving away from agriculture, it reflects a more integrated and resilient rural economy where farming remains central but is supported by multiple livelihood options. Stronger institutions such as\ncooperatives, Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs),\nand\nSelf-Help Groups (SHGs)\n have improved access to\ncredit, technology,\nand\n organised markets\n, helping small producers connect better with value chains.\n\nLivestock and Fisheries: Drivers of Rural Income Diversification and Growth\n\nWithin allied agricultural activities,\nlivestock\nand\nfisheries\n have demonstrated relatively stable growth rates of approximately\n5-6 percent\n, underscoring their strategic importance in generating rural incomes. Their economic significance lies in generating regular and comparatively predictable cash flows.\nDairy production\n facilitates frequent income realisation through routine milk sales, while fisheries enable\nmultiple production cycles\n, thereby providing sustained employment opportunities. Furthermore, dairy-based rural households commonly integrate crop cultivation for food and fodder with\nlivestock rearing, enabling circular resource use\n and reducing dependence on external inputs.  Such diversification reduces reliance on a\nsingle income source\n and enhances resilience to\nseasonal\nand\nmarket shocks.\n\nBetween\nFY15\nand\n FY24,\n the sector’s\nGross Value Added\n (GVA) increased by nearly\n195 percent,\n reflecting a\ncompound annual growth rate (CAGR\n) of\n12.77 percent\n at current prices. In the\nUnion Budget 2026–27\n,\n₹6,153.46 crore\n has been allocated to the Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying, reflecting a\n16 percent\n increase from\n₹5,302.83 crore\n in\nFY 2025–26.\n This expansion underscores the\nsector’s role in income diversification\n and livelihood resilience, supported by investments in breed improvement, veterinary infrastructure, and disease control.\n\nIndia as a Global Leader in Livestock and Fisheries\n\nIndia holds the\nleading global position\n in milk production, accounting for nearly\n25 percent of global output.\n Over the decade, the sector has recorded a compound annual growth rate of\n5.41 percent,\n with production increasing from\n146.31 million tonnes\n in 2014–15 to\n247.87 million\n tonnes in 2024–25, representing a growth of over\n69.4 percent.\n This sustained expansion has contributed to\nimproved nutritional access\n, reflected in per capita milk availability of\n485 grams\n per day in 2024–25, significantly exceeding the global average of\n328 grams.\n\nIndia\nranks second\n globally in\negg production.\n National output has increased from\n78.48 billion eggs\n in 2014–15 to an estimated\n149.11 billion egg\ns in 2024–25, reflecting a\ncompound annual growth rate (CAGR)\nof\n 6.63 percent\n more than a decade. This sustained expansion has translated into improved\naccess to nutrition\n, with per capita egg availability rising from\n62 eggs per annum\n in 2014–15 to\n106 eggs per annum\n in 2024–25.\n\nIndia is the\nworld’s second-largest fish producer\n. Output has increased to\n19.77 million tonnes\n in FY 2024-25 from 9.58 million tonnes in FY 2013-14. It contributes nearly\n8 percent of global output\nand supports over\n30 million livelihoods\n, thereby constituting a central pillar of the blue economy. Coastal States and Union Territories, comprising approximately\n4,434 fishing villages,\n account for\n72 percent of production\n and\n76 percent of seafood exports\n.   The sector contributes\n7.43 percent\nto agricultural GVA, with policy measures such as reducing GST on key fish products and enhancing domestic demand and export competitiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia\nranks fourth globally\n in meat production. Output has increased from\n6.69 million tonnes\n in 2014–15 to\n10.50 million tonnes\n in 2024–25, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of\n4.61 percent\n. Taken together, these indicators affirm India’s prominent position as a major contributor within the domestic and global agri-food economy.\n\nPolicy-led Intervention for Livestock Productivity\n\nThe expansion of India’s livestock sector has been driven by focused government interventions through initiatives such as the\nNational Livestock Mission (NLM)\n, the\nRashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM), and the National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP),\n which emphasise productivity improvement, animal health, breed development, and livestock-based entrepreneurships. Together, these initiatives have strengthened livestock systems, reduced production risks, and reinforced livestock as a resilient and diversified source of income for rural households.\n\nThe\nNational Livestock Mission\n promotes livestock-based entrepreneurship, improves breed productivity, and boosts production of meat, eggs, milk, and fodder.\n\nThe\nRashtriya Gokul Mission\n focuses on conserving indigenous bovine breeds, enhancing milk productivity, and making dairying more remunerative for rural farmers.\n\nThe\nNational Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP)\n focuses on controlling Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis through 100% vaccination of cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and pigs against FMD, and vaccination of all female bovine calves (4–8 months) against Brucellosis.\n\nGenetic Improvement through Artificial Insemination with Last Mile Service Delivery\n\nGenetic improvement interventions under the RGM have reinforced productivity-led growth within the livestock sector mentioned as follows:\n\nA total of\n14.56 crore artificial inseminations\n have been conducted, covering\n9.36 crore animals and benefiting 5.62 crore farmers\n.\n\nThe training of nearly\n39,810 MAITRI artificial insemination technicians\n has strengthened last-mile service delivery.\n\nThese measures have accelerated genetic gains, improved milk yields, and strengthened the income potential of dairy-based livelihoods\n.\n\nStrengthening Animal Health and Risk Mitigation\n\nLivestock productivity and income stability are closely linked to disease control. Under the\nNADCP\n, large-scale vaccination and surveillance efforts have significantly reduced disease incidence. Over\n125.75 crore\n\nFoot and Mouth Disease (FMD)\n vaccinations were administered, and approximately\n26.27\n crore farmers benefited. Vaccination coverage expanded in 2025 to include pastoral sheep and goats.\n\nFMD\n outbreaks\nreduced\n sharply from\n132\ncases in\n2019\n to\n6\n cases in\n2025\n\nBrucellosis\n outbreaks have been\nreduced\n to\nzero\n\nThe decline in disease outbreaks has mitigated productivity losses.\n\nLivestock Productivity Enhancement Supporting Livelihood Diversification\n\nThe combined impact of genetic and health interventions is reflected in sustained improvements in bovine productivity. India is home to the world's largest bovine population and has witnessed significant growth in meat and poultry production.\n\nIndigenous (local)\n and\nnon-descript (mix-breed)\n cattle\nproductivity increased\n from\n927 kg\nper animal per year\n(2014–15)\n to\n1,292 kg (2023–24),\n a rise of\n39.37\n percent.\n\nBuffalo productivity increased from\n1,880 kg to 2,161 kg\n, registering\n14.94\n percent growth during the same period.\n\nAverage bovine productivity improved from\n1,648.17 kg (2013–14)\n to\n2,079 kg (2024–25),\n reflecting a\n27 percent\n rise.\n\nThese productivity gains represent one of the highest recorded improvements globally and directly enhance income realisation from dairy-based livelihoods.\n\nScaling Milk Procurement and Processing Capacity\n\nThe expansion of dairy cooperatives has played a pivotal role in strengthening market integration by incorporating smallholders into organised procurement and processing systems.\n\nThe dairy network encompasses:\n\n22 milk federations\n,\n241 district unions\n,\n28 marketing dairies\n,\n\n25 Milk Producer Organisations\n (MPOs), covering approximately\n2.35 lakh villages\nand\n 1.72 crore farmer-members\n.\n\n31,908 dairy cooperative societies\n have been organised, integrating\n17.63 lakh producers\n into formal value chains and increasing daily milk\nprocurement\n by\n120.68 lakh kilograms.\n\nIndia is strengthening value addition through the planned expansion of milk\nprocessing capacity\n to\n100 million litres per day\n by 2028–29, from the current\n660 lakh litres per day\n, strengthening the sector’s contribution to food security and farm incomes.\n\n\n\nInstitutional Credit Support for Livestock\n\nAccess to\naffordable institutional credit\n has been instrumental in enabling\nlivelihood diversification\n within the livestock and fisheries sectors, facilitating producers’ transition from\nsubsistence-based operations\nto\nformal market integration.\nUnder the\nKisan Credit Card\n (KCC) scheme, substantial credit support has been extended to allied activities to meet working capital requirements, promote\nasset formation,\n and\nreduce reliance on informal lending\n channels. The facts and figures indicate a strong institutional response to credit demand in allied agricultural activities.\n\n\n\nIn animal husbandry, the exceptionally high acceptance rate,\n55.08 lakh\n out of\n 55.9 lakh\napplications, reflects effective screening mechanisms and sustained policy support. The sanctioning of\n39.22 lakh\n applications further suggests substantial credit flow, translating into actual financial support.\n\n\n\nPolicy-led Intervention for India’s Fisheries Sector\n\nOver the decade, India’s fisheries sector has recorded a sustained average annual growth rate of\n8.74 percent,\n with total fish production increasing from\n95.79 lakh tonnes\n in 2013–14 to\n197.75 lakh tonnes\n in 2024–25. Inland fisheries and aquaculture have been the primary drivers of this expansion, registering\na 147 percent increase\n from\n61.36 lakh tonnes\n to\n151.60 lakh tonnes\n during the same period.\n\nThe\nUnion Budget 2026-27\n allocated a record\n₹\n2,761.80 crore\n (approximately USD 332.75 million) to fisheries, reinforcing\nsustained investment\n initiated under the\nBlue Revolution\n and consolidating India’s leadership in aquaculture and seafood exports. This trajectory underscores fisheries as a key growth engine within non-farm livelihood diversification, particularly in rural and coastal regions.\n\nDeep-sea and offshore fisheries further integrate India into global seafood value chains, strengthening the sector’s economic and food security importance. This integration has been reinforced through focused interventions under the\nPradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)\n and\nPradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana (PM-MKSSY),\n under which seafood exports have more than doubled from\n₹\n30,213 crore\n in\n2013–\n14\n to\n₹\n62,408 crore\n in\n2024–\n25\n, reaching over 130 countries\n.\n\nPradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)\n promotes fisheries development through infrastructure, modernization, and value chain strengthening to boost production, exports, jobs, and fishers’ incomes.\n\nPradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana (PM-MKSSY), a\nsub-scheme of PMMSY, supports sector formalisation through insurance, credit, performance incentives, and traceability to improve income security and sustainability for fish farmers.\n\nStrengthening Fisheries Infrastructure and Market Access\n\nUnder PMSSY, Productivity gains have been accompanied by large-scale infrastructure development to reduce post-harvest losses and improve market access.\n\n27,189\n fish transportation and handling units established\n\n6,733\n fish retail markets and kiosks sanctioned\n\n128\n value-added enterprise units supported\n\nTo bridge infrastructure gaps, the\nFisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF),\n launched in 2018–19 with a corpus of\n₹\n7,522.48 crore\n, supports fishing harbours, landing centres, aquaculture units, and cold-chain logistics.\n\nInstitutional Credit Support for fisheries\n\nIn fisheries,\n6.83 lakh applications\n were received under the\nKisan Credit Card (KCC)\n, of which\n6.77 lakh\n were accepted. Of which,\n4.82 lakh applications\nwere sanctioned\n,\nindicating a meaningful conversion of demand into credit access. Financial inclusion and welfare programmes have extended KCC benefits to\n4.39 lakh fishers\n, providing insurance coverage to\n3.3 million beneficiaries\n, and delivering livelihood assistance to an average of\n7.44 lakh fisher families\n during lean periods. These measures underscore the role of\nformal credit\n in enhancing resilience, stabilising incomes, and deepening integration with organised markets.\n\n\n\nSustainable Governance of Marine Fisheries and EEZ Resources\n\nIndia’s extensive coastline of over\n11,099 km\n and an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of approximately\n24 lakh square kilometres\n sustain the livelihoods of more than\n50 lakh members\n of the fishing community across 13 maritime States and Union Territories. Marine fisheries constitute a strategic component of the\nblue economy\n, contributing to\nexport earnings\nand\n national nutritional security\n.\n\nTo ensure responsible harnessing of aquatic resources, the Government has notified the\nRules and Guidelines for Sustainable Harnessing of Fisheries\n in the EEZ and High Seas (2025), establishing a\nforward-looking regulatory framework\n aligned with sustainability and international compliance standards. Policy measures granting\nduty-free status\n to catch landed abroad and treated as exports aim to enhance price realisation and global competitiveness, while\ntraceability, sustainability, and compliance safeguards mitigate misuse.\n The\nMarine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA)\n further anchors sustainable export growth through\nquality assurance, market facilitation\n, capacity building, and ecological stewardship, reinforcing long-term resource security and livelihood resilience.\n\nMission-Driven Reservoir Development and Fisheries Value Chain Expansion\n\nIndia possesses one of the world’s largest inland reservoir networks, spanning approximately\n31.5 lakh hectares,\n which presents significant potential for expanding inland fisheries. Under\nMission Amrit Sarovar\n, the Government of India has facilitated the development of\n68,827 Amrit Sarovars\n, including\n1,222 water bodies\n integrated with fisheries activities, thereby promoting\nfish culture, livelihood diversification,\n and the\n enhancement of aquatic ecosystems.\nThe targeted interventions are proposed to integrate the development of\n500 reservoirs and Amrit Sarovars\nto further consolidate the\nfisheries value chain\n, particularly across coastal and inland regions. These measures seek to\nstrengthen market linkages\n and\nvalue addition\n by involving startups,\nwomen-led collectives,\n and\nFish Farmer Producer Organizations\n (FFPOs), fostering inclusive growth, entrepreneurship, and sustainable fisheries-based livelihoods.\n\nData-driven Institutional Reform in Livestock and Fisheries Sectors\n\nDigitalisation has become a critical instrument for enhancing\nefficiency, transparency,\nand\n producer welfare\n in the dairy sector. The introduction of the\n12-digit unique livestock identification system\n,\nPashu Aadhaar\n, has established a foundational\ndigital architecture\n for recording animal health, breeding, and service delivery transactions, thereby enabling data-driven planning and\nreal-time access\nfor farmers and veterinarians.\n\nBy January 2026, more than\n36.45 crore livestock\n had been registered on the\nBharat Pashudhan Portal\n.\n\nComplementing this, the\nAutomatic Milk Collection System (AMCS)\n has improved transparency in procurement through\nautomated quality testing\n and pricing, ensuring\ntimely payments\n.\n\nThe\nInternet-based Dairy Information System (i-DIS)\n further integrates data across unions and federations, enabling performance monitoring.\n\nOperational in 12 States and Union Territories,\n\nAMCS covers over\n26,000 cooperative societies\nand benefits\n17.3 lakh producers.\n\nParallel digital reforms\n in fisheries include the\nNational Fisheries Digital Platform (NFDP),\n launched in 2024, under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana. NFDP creates digital identities and a unified national database for fishers and enterprises, facilitating\naccess to credit, insurance, traceability,\nand\nperformance incentives\n. With over\n28 lakh stakeholders registered\n, integration of 12 banks on a common digital platform, and 217 loans disbursed, the platform advances formalisation, financial inclusion, and transparency in the fisheries value chain. Together, these digital platforms are reinforcing market integration, reducing transaction costs, and improving income certainty.\n\nSustainable Marine and Dairy Economies: Advancing Inclusive Growth and the SDGs\n\nIndia’s marine and dairy economies constitute foundational pillars of\nsustainable livelihoods, nutritional security,\nand\n inclusive growth\naligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Sustainable management of marine resources, aligned with\nSDG 14,\n is particularly critical given India’s\nEEZ exceeding 2 million square kilometres\n, necessitating\neffective governance of deep-sea\n and offshore fisheries to prevent overexploitation,\nconserve biodiversity\n, and\nsafeguard food and livelihood security.\n\nComplementing this, the dairy sector advances multiple social SDGs by sustaining the livelihoods of nearly\n150 million farmers\n, particularly smallholders, thereby contributing to poverty reduction\n(SDG 1),\n productive employment\n(SDG 8),\n and reduced inequalities\n(SDG 10).\n Collectively, sustainable fisheries and inclusive dairy development reinforce integrated and equitable progress across key Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nConclusion\n\nIndia’s strategic focus on\nlivelihood diversification\n through the dairy and fisheries sectors has successfully transitioned rural households from\nsubsistence-oriented production to market-integrated, commercially viable models\n. Beyond enhancing farm incomes, diversification contributes to\nemployment generation\n,\nrisk mitigation,\n\nand the\n\nstrengthening of food system\n\nresilience\n. India has emerged as the\nworld leader in milk production\n and ranks second in fish and egg production, achieving significant productivity gains without necessarily increasing herd sizes. The expansion of cooperatives, Farmer-Producer Organizations (FPOs), and Self-Help Groups (SHGs) has deepened market integration, providing small producers with\nbetter bargaining power\nand\nstructured value chains.\n\nThe deployment of digital public infrastructure, such as Pashu Aadhaar and the National Fisheries Digital Platform, alongside the expansion of Kisan Credit Cards (KCC), has\nenhanced transparency, reduced transaction costs\n, and provided essential liquidity to rural producers. These sectors are vital for the\neconomic empowerment of women and smallholders\n, supporting livelihoods on a large scale, and aligning with global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for poverty reduction and\nenvironmental stewardship\n. Together, the\nconvergence of productivity-led growth\n, institutional support, and technological innovation has created a resilient rural economy capable of withstanding seasonal and market shocks while ensuring\nnational nutritional security.\n\nReferences\n\nMinistry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying\n\nhttps://nlm.udyamimitra.in/\n\nhttps://dahd.gov.in/schemes/programmes/rashtriya_gokul_mission\n\nhttps://bharatpashudhan.ndlm.co.in/\n\nhttps://www.pmmsy.dof.gov.in/\n\nhttps://pmmkssy.dof.gov.in/pmmkssy/#/\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2221582&reg=3&lang=1\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2213532&reg=3&lang=1\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=2212290&reg=3&lang=2\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2101856&reg=3&lang=2\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2184705&reg=3&lang=2\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2205031&reg=3&lang=2\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=2225246&reg=3&lang=2\n\nhttps://mofpi.gov.in/sites/default/files/KnowledgeCentre/Sector%20Profile/Sector_Profile_Fisheries.pdf\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2221788&reg=3&lang=2\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2225763&reg=3&lang=1\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2225760&reg=3&lang=1\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?NoteId=156127&ModuleId=3&reg=3&lang=1\n\n\nMinistry of Finance\n\nhttps://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/budget_speech.pdf\n\nhttps://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/doc/echapter.pdf\n\nMinistry of Rural Development\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2122478&reg=3&lang=2\n\nMinistry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI)\n\nhttps://mofpi.gov.in/sites/default/files/KnowledgeCentre/Sector%20Profile/Sector_profile_Meat_Poultry_(1)22.pdf\n\nLok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Questions\n\nhttps://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/185/AU4180_nfJzOf.pdf?source=pqals\n\nhttps://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/185/AU2500_MY7k37.pdf?source=pqals\n\nhttps://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/184/AU4923_3Zmrxj.pdf?source=pqals\n\nhttps://sansad.in/getFile/annex/268/AU384_3ncA5j.pdf?source=pqars\n\nhttps://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/185/AS371_0BKEvo.pdf?source=pqals\n\nhttps://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/186/AU2737_Zmswwv.pdf?source=pqals\n\nhttps://sansad.in/getFile/annex/268/AU1181_cZK9ZJ.pdf?source=pqars\n\nhttps://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/185/AU3729_txHX3D.pdf?source=pqals\n\nFood and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)\n\nhttps://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/beee9189-d92d-4a0d-86af-a1e3328c33d1/content\n\nhttps://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/meat-eggs-and-milk-essential-source-of-nutrients-new-fao-report-says-250423/en\n\nhttps://www.fao.org/fsnforum/consultation/eggs-nutrition?page=1\n\nNiti Aayog\n\nhttps://niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2025-10/Indias-Blue-Economy-Strategy-For-Harnessing-Deep-Sea-And-Offshore-Fisheries.pdf\n\nhttps://niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2025-10/Reimagining_Agriculture_Roadmap_for_Frontier_Technology_Led_Transformation.pdf\n\nPress Information Bureau\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?NoteId=156873&ModuleId=3&reg=3&lang=1\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2194086&reg=3&lang=2\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?NoteId=155298&ModuleId=3&reg=3&lang=2\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2192114&reg=3&lang=2\n\nClick here to see PDF\n\n******\n\nPIB Research\n\n(Release ID: 2234117)\n\nVisitor Counter : 7\n\nPIB Headquarters\n\nStrengthening Allied Sector and Market Access\n\nTransforming India’s Livestock and Fisheries Sector\n\nPosted On:\n01 MAR 2026 10:43AM by PIB Delhi\n\nIntroduction\n\nIndia’s agricultural progress is increasingly supported by the expansion of\nallied sectors\n such as\nlivestock, dairy, poultry, and fisheries\n.

Rather than moving away from agriculture, it reflects a more integrated and resilient rural economy where farming remains central but is supported by multiple livelihood options. Stronger institutions such as\ncooperatives, Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs),\nand\nSelf-Help Groups (SHGs)\n have improved access to\ncredit, technology,\nand\n organised markets\n, helping small producers connect better with value chains.\n\nLivestock and Fisheries: Drivers of Rural Income Diversification and Growth\n\nWithin allied agricultural activities,\nlivestock\nand\nfisheries\n have demonstrated relatively stable growth rates of approximately\n5-6 percent\n, underscoring their strategic importance in generating rural incomes. Their economic significance lies in generating regular and comparatively predictable cash flows.\nDairy production\n facilitates frequent income realisation through routine milk sales, while fisheries enable\nmultiple production cycles\n, thereby providing sustained employment opportunities. Furthermore, dairy-based rural households commonly integrate crop cultivation for food and fodder with\nlivestock rearing, enabling circular resource use\n and reducing dependence on external inputs.  Such diversification reduces reliance on a\nsingle income source\n and enhances resilience to\nseasonal\nand\nmarket shocks.\n\nBetween\nFY15\nand\n FY24,\n the sector’s\nGross Value Added\n (GVA) increased by nearly\n195 percent,\n reflecting a\ncompound annual growth rate (CAGR\n) of\n12.77 percent\n at current prices. In the\nUnion Budget 2026–27\n,\n₹6,153.46 crore\n has been allocated to the Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying, reflecting a\n16 percent\n increase from\n₹5,302.83 crore\n in\nFY 2025–26.\n This expansion underscores the\nsector’s role in income diversification\n and livelihood resilience, supported by investments in breed improvement, veterinary infrastructure, and disease control.\n\nIndia as a Global Leader in Livestock and Fisheries\n\nIndia holds the\nleading global position\n in milk production, accounting for nearly\n25 percent of global output.\n Over the decade, the sector has recorded a compound annual growth rate of\n5.41 percent,\n with production increasing from\n146.31 million tonnes\n in 2014–15 to\n247.87 million\n tonnes in 2024–25, representing a growth of over\n69.4 percent.\n This sustained expansion has contributed to\nimproved nutritional access\n, reflected in per capita milk availability of\n485 grams\n per day in 2024–25, significantly exceeding the global average of\n328 grams.\n\nIndia\nranks second\n globally in\negg production.\n National output has increased from\n78.48 billion eggs\n in 2014–15 to an estimated\n149.11 billion egg\ns in 2024–25, reflecting a\ncompound annual growth rate (CAGR)\nof\n 6.63 percent\n more than a decade. This sustained expansion has translated into improved\naccess to nutrition\n, with per capita egg availability rising from\n62 eggs per annum\n in 2014–15 to\n106 eggs per annum\n in 2024–25.\n\nIndia is the\nworld’s second-largest fish producer\n. Output has increased to\n19.77 million tonnes\n in FY 2024-25 from 9.58 million tonnes in FY 2013-14. It contributes nearly\n8 percent of global output\nand supports over\n30 million livelihoods\n, thereby constituting a central pillar of the blue economy. Coastal States and Union Territories, comprising approximately\n4,434 fishing villages,\n account for\n72 percent of production\n and\n76 percent of seafood exports\n.   The sector contributes\n7.43 percent\nto agricultural GVA, with policy measures such as reducing GST on key fish products and enhancing domestic demand and export competitiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia\nranks fourth globally\n in meat production. Output has increased from\n6.69 million tonnes\n in 2014–15 to\n10.50 million tonnes\n in 2024–25, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of\n4.61 percent\n. Taken together, these indicators affirm India’s prominent position as a major contributor within the domestic and global agri-food economy.\n\nPolicy-led Intervention for Livestock Productivity\n\nThe expansion of India’s livestock sector has been driven by focused government interventions through initiatives such as the\nNational Livestock Mission (NLM)\n, the\nRashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM), and the National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP),\n which emphasise productivity improvement, animal health, breed development, and livestock-based entrepreneurships. Together, these initiatives have strengthened livestock systems, reduced production risks, and reinforced livestock as a resilient and diversified source of income for rural households.\n\nThe\nNational Livestock Mission\n promotes livestock-based entrepreneurship, improves breed productivity, and boosts production of meat, eggs, milk, and fodder.\n\nThe\nRashtriya Gokul Mission\n focuses on conserving indigenous bovine breeds, enhancing milk productivity, and making dairying more remunerative for rural farmers.\n\nThe\nNational Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP)\n focuses on controlling Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis through 100% vaccination of cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and pigs against FMD, and vaccination of all female bovine calves (4–8 months) against Brucellosis.\n\nGenetic Improvement through Artificial Insemination with Last Mile Service Delivery\n\nGenetic improvement interventions under the RGM have reinforced productivity-led growth within the livestock sector mentioned as follows:\n\nA total of\n14.56 crore artificial inseminations\n have been conducted, covering\n9.36 crore animals and benefiting 5.62 crore farmers\n.\n\nThe training of nearly\n39,810 MAITRI artificial insemination technicians\n has strengthened last-mile service delivery.\n\nThese measures have accelerated genetic gains, improved milk yields, and strengthened the income potential of dairy-based livelihoods\n.\n\nStrengthening Animal Health and Risk Mitigation\n\nLivestock productivity and income stability are closely linked to disease control. Under the\nNADCP\n, large-scale vaccination and surveillance efforts have significantly reduced disease incidence. Over\n125.75 crore\n\nFoot and Mouth Disease (FMD)\n vaccinations were administered, and approximately\n26.27\n crore farmers benefited. Vaccination coverage expanded in 2025 to include pastoral sheep and goats.\n\nFMD\n outbreaks\nreduced\n sharply from\n132\ncases in\n2019\n to\n6\n cases in\n2025\n\nBrucellosis\n outbreaks have been\nreduced\n to\nzero\n\nThe decline in disease outbreaks has mitigated productivity losses.\n\nLivestock Productivity Enhancement Supporting Livelihood Diversification\n\nThe combined impact of genetic and health interventions is reflected in sustained improvements in bovine productivity. India is home to the world's largest bovine population and has witnessed significant growth in meat and poultry production.\n\nIndigenous (local)\n and\nnon-descript (mix-breed)\n cattle\nproductivity increased\n from\n927 kg\nper animal per year\n(2014–15)\n to\n1,292 kg (2023–24),\n a rise of\n39.37\n percent.\n\nBuffalo productivity increased from\n1,880 kg to 2,161 kg\n, registering\n14.94\n percent growth during the same period.\n\nAverage bovine productivity improved from\n1,648.17 kg (2013–14)\n to\n2,079 kg (2024–25),\n reflecting a\n27 percent\n rise.\n\nThese productivity gains represent one of the highest recorded improvements globally and directly enhance income realisation from dairy-based livelihoods.\n\nScaling Milk Procurement and Processing Capacity\n\nThe expansion of dairy cooperatives has played a pivotal role in strengthening market integration by incorporating smallholders into organised procurement and processing systems.\n\nThe dairy network encompasses:\n\n22 milk federations\n,\n241 district unions\n,\n28 marketing dairies\n,\n\n25 Milk Producer Organisations\n (MPOs), covering approximately\n2.35 lakh villages\nand\n 1.72 crore farmer-members\n.\n\n31,908 dairy cooperative societies\n have been organised, integrating\n17.63 lakh producers\n into formal value chains and increasing daily milk\nprocurement\n by\n120.68 lakh kilograms.\n\nIndia is strengthening value addition through the planned expansion of milk\nprocessing capacity\n to\n100 million litres per day\n by 2028–29, from the current\n660 lakh litres per day\n, strengthening the sector’s contribution to food security and farm incomes.\n\n\n\nInstitutional Credit Support for Livestock\n\nAccess to\naffordable institutional credit\n has been instrumental in enabling\nlivelihood diversification\n within the livestock and fisheries sectors, facilitating producers’ transition from\nsubsistence-based operations\nto\nformal market integration.\nUnder the\nKisan Credit Card\n (KCC) scheme, substantial credit support has been extended to allied activities to meet working capital requirements, promote\nasset formation,\n and\nreduce reliance on informal lending\n channels. The facts and figures indicate a strong institutional response to credit demand in allied agricultural activities.\n\n\n\nIn animal husbandry, the exceptionally high acceptance rate,\n55.08 lakh\n out of\n 55.9 lakh\napplications, reflects effective screening mechanisms and sustained policy support. The sanctioning of\n39.22 lakh\n applications further suggests substantial credit flow, translating into actual financial support.\n\n\n\nPolicy-led Intervention for India’s Fisheries Sector\n\nOver the decade, India’s fisheries sector has recorded a sustained average annual growth rate of\n8.74 percent,\n with total fish production increasing from\n95.79 lakh tonnes\n in 2013–14 to\n197.75 lakh tonnes\n in 2024–25. Inland fisheries and aquaculture have been the primary drivers of this expansion, registering\na 147 percent increase\n from\n61.36 lakh tonnes\n to\n151.60 lakh tonnes\n during the same period.\n\nThe\nUnion Budget 2026-27\n allocated a record\n₹\n2,761.80 crore\n (approximately USD 332.75 million) to fisheries, reinforcing\nsustained investment\n initiated under the\nBlue Revolution\n and consolidating India’s leadership in aquaculture and seafood exports. This trajectory underscores fisheries as a key growth engine within non-farm livelihood diversification, particularly in rural and coastal regions.\n\nDeep-sea and offshore fisheries further integrate India into global seafood value chains, strengthening the sector’s economic and food security importance. This integration has been reinforced through focused interventions under the\nPradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)\n and\nPradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana (PM-MKSSY),\n under which seafood exports have more than doubled from\n₹\n30,213 crore\n in\n2013–\n14\n to\n₹\n62,408 crore\n in\n2024–\n25\n, reaching over 130 countries\n.\n\nPradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)\n promotes fisheries development through infrastructure, modernization, and value chain strengthening to boost production, exports, jobs, and fishers’ incomes.\n\nPradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana (PM-MKSSY), a\nsub-scheme of PMMSY, supports sector formalisation through insurance, credit, performance incentives, and traceability to improve income security and sustainability for fish farmers.\n\nStrengthening Fisheries Infrastructure and Market Access\n\nUnder PMSSY, Productivity gains have been accompanied by large-scale infrastructure development to reduce post-harvest losses and improve market access.\n\n27,189\n fish transportation and handling units established\n\n6,733\n fish retail markets and kiosks sanctioned\n\n128\n value-added enterprise units supported\n\nTo bridge infrastructure gaps, the\nFisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF),\n launched in 2018–19 with a corpus of\n₹\n7,522.48 crore\n, supports fishing harbours, landing centres, aquaculture units, and cold-chain logistics.\n\nInstitutional Credit Support for fisheries\n\nIn fisheries,\n6.83 lakh applications\n were received under the\nKisan Credit Card (KCC)\n, of which\n6.77 lakh\n were accepted. Of which,\n4.82 lakh applications\nwere sanctioned\n,\nindicating a meaningful conversion of demand into credit access. Financial inclusion and welfare programmes have extended KCC benefits to\n4.39 lakh fishers\n, providing insurance coverage to\n3.3 million beneficiaries\n, and delivering livelihood assistance to an average of\n7.44 lakh fisher families\n during lean periods. These measures underscore the role of\nformal credit\n in enhancing resilience, stabilising incomes, and deepening integration with organised markets.\n\n\n\nSustainable Governance of Marine Fisheries and EEZ Resources\n\nIndia’s extensive coastline of over\n11,099 km\n and an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of approximately\n24 lakh square kilometres\n sustain the livelihoods of more than\n50 lakh members\n of the fishing community across 13 maritime States and Union Territories. Marine fisheries constitute a strategic component of the\nblue economy\n, contributing to\nexport earnings\nand\n national nutritional security\n.\n\nTo ensure responsible harnessing of aquatic resources, the Government has notified the\nRules and Guidelines for Sustainable Harnessing of Fisheries\n in the EEZ and High Seas (2025), establishing a\nforward-looking regulatory framework\n aligned with sustainability and international compliance standards. Policy measures granting\nduty-free status\n to catch landed abroad and treated as exports aim to enhance price realisation and global competitiveness, while\ntraceability, sustainability, and compliance safeguards mitigate misuse.\n The\nMarine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA)\n further anchors sustainable export growth through\nquality assurance, market facilitation\n, capacity building, and ecological stewardship, reinforcing long-term resource security and livelihood resilience.\n\nMission-Driven Reservoir Development and Fisheries Value Chain Expansion\n\nIndia possesses one of the world’s largest inland reservoir networks, spanning approximately\n31.5 lakh hectares,\n which presents significant potential for expanding inland fisheries. Under\nMission Amrit Sarovar\n, the Government of India has facilitated the development of\n68,827 Amrit Sarovars\n, including\n1,222 water bodies\n integrated with fisheries activities, thereby promoting\nfish culture, livelihood diversification,\n and the\n enhancement of aquatic ecosystems.\nThe targeted interventions are proposed to integrate the development of\n500 reservoirs and Amrit Sarovars\nto further consolidate the\nfisheries value chain\n, particularly across coastal and inland regions. These measures seek to\nstrengthen market linkages\n and\nvalue addition\n by involving startups,\nwomen-led collectives,\n and\nFish Farmer Producer Organizations\n (FFPOs), fostering inclusive growth, entrepreneurship, and sustainable fisheries-based livelihoods.\n\nData-driven Institutional Reform in Livestock and Fisheries Sectors\n\nDigitalisation has become a critical instrument for enhancing\nefficiency, transparency,\nand\n producer welfare\n in the dairy sector. The introduction of the\n12-digit unique livestock identification system\n,\nPashu Aadhaar\n, has established a foundational\ndigital architecture\n for recording animal health, breeding, and service delivery transactions, thereby enabling data-driven planning and\nreal-time access\nfor farmers and veterinarians.\n\nBy January 2026, more than\n36.45 crore livestock\n had been registered on the\nBharat Pashudhan Portal\n.\n\nComplementing this, the\nAutomatic Milk Collection System (AMCS)\n has improved transparency in procurement through\nautomated quality testing\n and pricing, ensuring\ntimely payments\n.\n\nThe\nInternet-based Dairy Information System (i-DIS)\n further integrates data across unions and federations, enabling performance monitoring.\n\nOperational in 12 States and Union Territories,\n\nAMCS covers over\n26,000 cooperative societies\nand benefits\n17.3 lakh producers.\n\nParallel digital reforms\n in fisheries include the\nNational Fisheries Digital Platform (NFDP),\n launched in 2024, under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana. NFDP creates digital identities and a unified national database for fishers and enterprises, facilitating\naccess to credit, insurance, traceability,\nand\nperformance incentives\n. With over\n28 lakh stakeholders registered\n, integration of 12 banks on a common digital platform, and 217 loans disbursed, the platform advances formalisation, financial inclusion, and transparency in the fisheries value chain. Together, these digital platforms are reinforcing market integration, reducing transaction costs, and improving income certainty.\n\nSustainable Marine and Dairy Economies: Advancing Inclusive Growth and the SDGs\n\nIndia’s marine and dairy economies constitute foundational pillars of\nsustainable livelihoods, nutritional security,\nand\n inclusive growth\naligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Sustainable management of marine resources, aligned with\nSDG 14,\n is particularly critical given India’s\nEEZ exceeding 2 million square kilometres\n, necessitating\neffective governance of deep-sea\n and offshore fisheries to prevent overexploitation,\nconserve biodiversity\n, and\nsafeguard food and livelihood security.\n\nComplementing this, the dairy sector advances multiple social SDGs by sustaining the livelihoods of nearly\n150 million farmers\n, particularly smallholders, thereby contributing to poverty reduction\n(SDG 1),\n productive employment\n(SDG 8),\n and reduced inequalities\n(SDG 10).\n Collectively, sustainable fisheries and inclusive dairy development reinforce integrated and equitable progress across key Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nConclusion\n\nIndia’s strategic focus on\nlivelihood diversification\n through the dairy and fisheries sectors has successfully transitioned rural households from\nsubsistence-oriented production to market-integrated, commercially viable models\n. Beyond enhancing farm incomes, diversification contributes to\nemployment generation\n,\nrisk mitigation,\n\nand the\n\nstrengthening of food system\n\nresilience\n. India has emerged as the\nworld leader in milk production\n and ranks second in fish and egg production, achieving significant productivity gains without necessarily increasing herd sizes. The expansion of cooperatives, Farmer-Producer Organizations (FPOs), and Self-Help Groups (SHGs) has deepened market integration, providing small producers with\nbetter bargaining power\nand\nstructured value chains.\n\nThe deployment of digital public infrastructure, such as Pashu Aadhaar and the National Fisheries Digital Platform, alongside the expansion of Kisan Credit Cards (KCC), has\nenhanced transparency, reduced transaction costs\n, and provided essential liquidity to rural producers. These sectors are vital for the\neconomic empowerment of women and smallholders\n, supporting livelihoods on a large scale, and aligning with global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for poverty reduction and\nenvironmental stewardship\n. Together, the\nconvergence of productivity-led growth\n, institutional support, and technological innovation has created a resilient rural economy capable of withstanding seasonal and market shocks while ensuring\nnational nutritional security.\n\nReferences\n\nMinistry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying\n\nhttps://nlm.udyamimitra.in/\n\nhttps://dahd.gov.in/schemes/programmes/rashtriya_gokul_mission\n\nhttps://bharatpashudhan.ndlm.co.in/\n\nhttps://www.pmmsy.dof.gov.in/\n\nhttps://pmmkssy.dof.gov.in/pmmkssy/#/\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2221582&reg=3&lang=1\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2213532&reg=3&lang=1\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=2212290&reg=3&lang=2\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2101856&reg=3&lang=2\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2184705&reg=3&lang=2\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2205031&reg=3&lang=2\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=2225246&reg=3&lang=2\n\nhttps://mofpi.gov.in/sites/default/files/KnowledgeCentre/Sector%20Profile/Sector_Profile_Fisheries.pdf\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2221788&reg=3&lang=2\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2225763&reg=3&lang=1\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2225760&reg=3&lang=1\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?NoteId=156127&ModuleId=3&reg=3&lang=1\n\n\nMinistry of Finance\n\nhttps://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/budget_speech.pdf\n\nhttps://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/doc/echapter.pdf\n\nMinistry of Rural Development\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2122478&reg=3&lang=2\n\nMinistry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI)\n\nhttps://mofpi.gov.in/sites/default/files/KnowledgeCentre/Sector%20Profile/Sector_profile_Meat_Poultry_(1)22.pdf\n\nLok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Questions\n\nhttps://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/185/AU4180_nfJzOf.pdf?source=pqals\n\nhttps://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/185/AU2500_MY7k37.pdf?source=pqals\n\nhttps://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/184/AU4923_3Zmrxj.pdf?source=pqals\n\nhttps://sansad.in/getFile/annex/268/AU384_3ncA5j.pdf?source=pqars\n\nhttps://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/185/AS371_0BKEvo.pdf?source=pqals\n\nhttps://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/186/AU2737_Zmswwv.pdf?source=pqals\n\nhttps://sansad.in/getFile/annex/268/AU1181_cZK9ZJ.pdf?source=pqars\n\nhttps://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/185/AU3729_txHX3D.pdf?source=pqals\n\nFood and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)\n\nhttps://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/beee9189-d92d-4a0d-86af-a1e3328c33d1/content\n\nhttps://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/meat-eggs-and-milk-essential-source-of-nutrients-new-fao-report-says-250423/en\n\nhttps://www.fao.org/fsnforum/consultation/eggs-nutrition?page=1\n\nNiti Aayog\n\nhttps://niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2025-10/Indias-Blue-Economy-Strategy-For-Harnessing-Deep-Sea-And-Offshore-Fisheries.pdf\n\nhttps://niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2025-10/Reimagining_Agriculture_Roadmap_for_Frontier_Technology_Led_Transformation.pdf\n\nPress Information Bureau\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?NoteId=156873&ModuleId=3&reg=3&lang=1\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2194086&reg=3&lang=2\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?NoteId=155298&ModuleId=3&reg=3&lang=2\n\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2192114&reg=3&lang=2\n\nClick here to see PDF\n\n******\n\nPIB Research\n\n(Release ID: 2234117)",
