V. Raman on 28 February 1928, CSIR–National Physical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL) celebrated National Science Day (NSD-2026) on 28 February 2026. “National Science Conclave” in the morning, while the “National Science Day Lecture” in the afternoon were celebrated as part of NSD 2026.\n\nThe programme commenced with the National Science Conclave, providing a vibrant platform to research scholars, students, and young scientists below 40 years of age to showcase their research through poster presentations under three broad thematic domains: Materials Science and Technology (MST), Physics, Engineering and Metrology (PEM), and Environment, Health and Chemistry (EHC). The best selected posters were awarded certificates of merit. This session aimed to nurture young scientific talent and promote interdisciplinary research.\n\nThe “National Science Day Lecture” began with opening remarks from Prof Venu Gopal Achanta, Director, CSIR-NPL, and a warm welcome to the distinguished dignitaries. Prof Achanta eloquently highlighted the historic association between CSIR-NPL and the Raman Effect through K. S. Krishnan, who found conclusive evidence for the Raman Effect. He is also the Founding  Director of CSIR-NPL. Prof. Achanta stressed on the need to find local solutions to local as well as global problems. He also emphasized the importance of embracing emerging challenges in quantum metrology and advancing metrological interventions in frontier areas of science and technology for societal applications.\n\nNational Science Day Lecture was delivered by the Chief Guest Prof. Bhim Singh, Vigyan Shri, ANRF National Science Chair Professor and Emeritus/Honorary Professor, IIT Delhi, who spoke on the theme “Electric Vehicle- a sustainable Energy Revolution”. Prof Singh emphasised the evolution, technologies, charging systems, and mission-driven roadmap of Electric Vehicles as a sustainable energy revolution. The Guest of Honor lecture was delivered by Prof. Prateek Sharma, Vice Chancellor, Delhi Technological University, who shared his perspectives on creating a repository of societal problems and on finding solutions to them in collaboration with academia and research labs, inspiring the audience with his vision for academia–research synergy and innovation-driven growth.\n\nThe programme concluded with a formal vote of thanks by Dr. Govind Gupta, Convener, NSD-2026. He highlighted the activities carried out by CSIR-NPL, including the organization of the First National Science Conclave, as well as the role of women in Science at Catalysis Viksit Bharat CSIR-NPL.\n\n*****\n\nNKR/AK/AV\n\n(Release ID: 2234120)\n\nVisitor Counter : 194\n\nRead this release in:\n\nUrdu\n\n,\n\nहिन्दी\n\nMinistry of Science & Technology\n\nCSIR-National Physical Laboratory Celebrates National Science Day\n\nPosted On:\n01 MAR 2026 11:54AM by PIB Delhi\n\nTo commemorate the historic announcement of the discovery of the Raman Effect by C.
