Shri Pankaj Agarwal, Secretary (Power), delivered the keynote address. Senior officials from Central Ministries, State Governments, State Designated Agencies (SDAs), and partner institutions were also present.\n\nRecalling the famous saying, “Prevention is better than cure,” Shri Manohar Lal remarked that the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) functions as a preventive institution for the power sector. Every unit of electricity conserved today directly contributes to reducing the need for additional generation capacity and lowering emissions. By adopting energy-efficient practices, we not only protect the environment but also secure a cleaner and more sustainable future for coming generations. He also lauded BEE for its significant contribution to advancing energy efficiency initiatives in the country.\n\nShri Manohar Lal highlighted India’s significant progress in meeting its climate commitments and strengthening energy efficiency as a core pillar of national development. He noted that India has reduced the emissions intensity of its GDP by 36% from 2005 levels and achieved 52% non-fossil fuel installed capacity ahead of the 2030 target.\n\nHe outlined key achievements under major BEE initiatives, including the Renewable Consumption Obligation (RCO), the Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) Scheme, the transition to the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE), the ADEETIE scheme for MSMEs, the Standards & Labelling (S&L) Programme, the Energy Conservation and Sustainable Building Code (ECSBC), and transport sector efficiency measures.\n\nEmphasising the way forward, he underscored the role of energy efficiency in achieving the vision of\nViksit Bharat @2047\n, while drawing attention to emerging areas such as data centres and Artificial Intelligence, which require efficient and sustainable energy management solutions.\n\nShri Pankaj Agarwal, Secretary (Power), outlined the evolving contours of India’s energy landscape, marked by rising demand, expanding non-fossil capacity, and increasing digitalisation. He described energy efficiency as India’s “First Fuel” and a key instrument for balancing energy security, affordability, and sustainability.\n\nHe highlighted BEE’s initiatives in cooling efficiency through S&L and ECSBC, industrial decarbonisation through the Carbon Market and the ADEETIE scheme, the establishment of energy efficiency hubs, and fuel efficiency improvements in the transport sector.\n\nEarlier, delivering his welcome address, Shri Krushna Chandra Panigrahy, Director General, BEE, reflected on the Bureau’s journey and reaffirmed its commitment to accelerating energy efficiency adoption across all sectors of the economy.\n\nOn the occasion, the BEE@25 logo was formally released to mark BEE’s entry into its 25th year. The logo symbolically reflects the core principles of energy efficiency, sustainability, and forward-looking innovation. The design prominently integrates the “@25” motif to signify the milestone year while incorporating visual elements that represent energy, growth, and environmental responsibility. The dynamic styling and colour scheme convey continuity, impact, and the Bureau’s evolving role in India’s energy transition. The commemorative logo will be used across official communications, outreach campaigns, publications, and awareness initiatives throughout the year, serving as the visual identity for the 25th year celebrations and reinforcing BEE’s commitment to advancing energy efficiency as a national priority.\n\nA specially curated\n\nBEE Journey Video was screened during the event, highlighting the Bureau’s evolution over the past twenty-four years, its major milestones, flagship programmes, institutional partnerships, and its contribution to strengthening India’s energy efficiency ecosystem.\n\nDuring the event, the RCO Portal (http://www.rco.beeindia.gov.in) was unveiled as a significant step towards strengthening monitoring, facilitating compliance, and streamlining coordination among stakeholders under various energy efficiency programmes. The portal is expected to enhance transparency, improve reporting mechanisms, and support data-driven decision-making within the implementation framework.\n\nThe Minister also launched the BEE Star Label Mobile Application, developed in collaboration with CLASP. The application will enable consumers to scan the QR code affixed to star-labelled appliances to instantly access authentic product information, including energy performance, model details, and compliance status. The app aims to enhance transparency, strengthen consumer awareness, and promote informed purchasing decisions by making energy efficiency information easily accessible at the point of sale. This initiative is expected to further reinforce the credibility of the Standards & Labelling Programme and encourage greater adoption of energy-efficient appliances across the country.\n\nThe celebration also featured a fireside interaction with former Directors General of BEE, moderated by Dr Satish Kumar, President and Executive Director of the Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy (AEEE). Retired officials of State Designated Agencies were felicitated for their dedicated service and valuable contributions to advancing energy conservation initiatives at the State level.\n\nThe 25th Foundation Day celebration reaffirmed BEE’s continued resolve to promote energy efficiency as a driver of sustainable growth, national energy security, and environmental responsibility, and to pave the way for a\nViksit\n and\nAtmanirbhar Bharat\n.\n\n****\n\nNR/MD\n\n(Release ID: 2234134)\n\nVisitor Counter : 168\n\nRead this release in:\n\nUrdu\n\n,\n\nहिन्दी\n\nMinistry of Power\n\nBureau of Energy Efficiency Commemorates 25th Foundation Day\n\nMinister of Power Graces 25th Foundation Day Celebrations; Unveils BEE@25 Logo, Launches BEE Star Label Mobile App and RCO Portal.\n\nPosted On:\n01 MAR 2026 12:54PM by PIB Delhi\n\nThe 25th Foundation Day of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), Ministry of Power, Government of India, was celebrated today at the India Habitat Centre, New Delhi, in the presence of senior dignitaries, policymakers, partner organisations, and stakeholders from across the country.\n\nShri Manohar Lal, Cabinet Minister of Power and Housing & Urban Affairs, graced the occasion as the Chief Guest.
