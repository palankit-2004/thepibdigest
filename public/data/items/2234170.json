The new Recombinant Cell facility promises to boost drug discovery as well as medical and Agri genomics.\n\nThe Minister also announced the foundation of a dedicated GMP facility, and released the book “Quantum Physics: One Hundred Magical Years” authored by Prof. V.P.N. Nampoori.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that India is preparing for a bio-driven economy where biotechnology will shape the future of manufacturing, healthcare, and sustainable growth.\n\nThe Minister said that in the last decade, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, biotechnology has received unprecedented policy support, enabling India to emerge as a global biotechnology hub. Referring to the recently launched BioE3 Policy, he said, India is among the few countries to bring out a dedicated biotechnology policy focused on economy, environment, and employment, anticipating the global shift towards biomanufacturing and bio-based industries.\n\nThe Union Minister was addressing scientists, students, and industry representatives during his visit to BRIC-Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (BRIC-RGCB) at its Akkulam campus in Thiruvananthapuram, Keralam, on National Science Day. The event was attended by Dr. Rajesh S. Gokhale, Secretary, Department of Biotechnology; Dr. Santosh, Director, BRIC-RGCB; senior scientists, faculty members, start-up incubatees and students.\n\nReferring to India’s biotechnology growth, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the country’s bioeconomy has expanded nearly sixteen times over the past decade, growing from around 10 billion US dollars to nearly 166 billion US dollars, with a target of reaching 300 billion US dollars in the coming years. He said the number of biotechnology start-ups has risen from about 50–70 in 2014 to over 11,000 today, reflecting the expanding innovation ecosystem supported by policy reforms and dedicated funding mechanisms, including recent initiatives for deep-tech start-ups.\n\nAbout the BRIC-RGCB’s new Central Facility for Recombinant Cells and Sensors, the Minister said the facility represents years of sustained research support and will significantly accelerate target-specific drug discovery and screening. The facility houses a large panel of engineered recombinant cells and advanced screening systems, developed through long-term government-supported programmes, and will serve academia, industry, and healthcare innovators across the country. The Department of Biotechnology has invested approximately Rs. 60 crores in creating this facility.\n\nDr Jitendra Singh also spoke about the rising burden of non-communicable diseases, including diabetes, fatty liver disease,and cancer. He said India is witnessing a steady rise in cancer incidence, with projections indicating a significant increase by 2030. In this context, he appreciated the institute’s research in cancer biology, including work on colon, oral, breast and cervical cancers. Referring to HPV vaccination, he recalled that India’s scientific institutions have contributed to global evidence supporting simplified vaccination schedules, and said preventive healthcare must go hand in hand with advanced research.\n\nAnnouncing the establishment of a dedicated GMP facility at BRIC-RGCB, the Minister said the upcoming facility will support pre-commercial production of biologics and cell-based therapies, including CAR-T therapy, in collaboration with clinical centres in Keralam. The facility will function as a bridge between laboratory research and industrial-scale production and will be available to biotech industries on a “pay-and-use” basis. The project will be implemented in two phases with a total investment of Rs. 80 crores by DBT.\n\nThe Minister also called for deeper collaboration among research institutions, private industry and emerging sectors such as nuclear medicine and deep-ocean research. He said recent policy measures have opened new avenues for private participation in advanced research domains and encouraged institutions in coastal states like Kerala to align biotechnology capabilities with national missions, including marine biodiversity and fisheries-linked innovation.\n\nDr Jitendra Singh said India’s scientific community today benefits from strong policy backing and decisive support at the highest level, enabling faster translation of research into real-world applications. He encouraged young researchers to take advantage of the expanding ecosystem and assured continued government support for innovation, entrepreneurship, and interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\nPHOTO : Union Minister Dr Jitendra Singh inaugurating new state-of-the-art facility at BRIC-Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology at Thiruvananthapuram, Keralam.\n\n\n\n\n\n*****\n\nNKR/AK/AV\n\n(Release ID: 2234170)\n\nVisitor Counter : 137\n\nRead this release in:\n\nUrdu\n\n,\n\nTamil\n\nMinistry of Science & Technology\n\nDr Jitendra Singh inaugurates Central Facility for Recombinant Cells and Sensors at BRIC-RGCB Thiruvananthapuram, Keralam; developed at a cost of approximately Rs 60 cr, the new facility promises to boost Drug Discovery and Medical, Agri Genomics\n\nFrom around 50 to over 11,000 Biotech Start-Ups in 11 years, Signal India’s Shift Towards a Bio-Driven Economy, says Union Minister Dr Jitendra Singh\nBioE3 Policy to Power India’s $300 Billion Biomanufacturing Future; Bioeconomy Grows 16-Fold in a Decade: Dr Jitendra Singh\nNew GMP Facility at BRIC-RGCB to Boost CAR-T & Cell-Based Therapies; Science to Drive Economic Growth and Public Health Outcomes: Dr Jitendra Singh\n\nPosted On:\n01 MAR 2026 3:14PM by PIB Delhi\n\nUnion Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences; MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh today inaugurated the new state-of-the-art \"Central Facility for Recombinant Cells and Sensors\" at BRIC-Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology.
