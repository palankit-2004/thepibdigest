V. Raman and his path-breaking discovery of the Raman Effect.\n\nAn exhibition showcasing the life, scientific journey, and pioneering contributions of Sir C. V. Raman was displayed along Dr. C. V. Raman Marg, drawing members of the public and creating awareness about India’s rich scientific heritage.\n\nAdding a strong experiential dimension to the celebration, scientists from CSIR–National Physical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL), namely Dr. Subashis Panja, Dr. Shibu Saha, and Dr. Vidyanand Singh, along with Dr. Soumik Siddhanta and Mr. Himanshu Yadav (Ph.D. student) from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi), conducted a live demonstration of the Raman Effect. The demonstration enabled participants to witness firsthand the phenomenon that revolutionised modern spectroscopy and continues to underpin advancements in science and technology.\n\nThis was followed by an engaging lecture session delivered jointly by the scientists from CSIR-NPL and IIT Delhi, who explained the Raman Effect, its scientific significance, and its wide-ranging applications in fields such as materials science, chemistry, medicine, and industry. The session was attended by enthusiastic school students as well as undergraduate students from Jamia Hamdard, who interacted actively with the experts.\n\nIn addition, participating students were taken on a guided visit to various laboratories at CSIR-IGIB, where they were introduced to ongoing research activities and cutting-edge facilities, further enriching their exposure to contemporary scientific research.\n\nIn a special public outreach initiative to mark the occasion, the Science Communication and Dissemination Directorate, CSIR Headquarters, in collaboration with the Ministry of Culture, organised the illumination of the iconic Qutub Minar in the evening. The monument was specially lit up to spread awareness about National Science Day and to celebrate the transformative role of science in society.\n\nThrough these nationwide activities, CSIR reaffirmed its commitment to fostering scientific temper, inspiring young learners, and bringing science closer to society in meaningful and engaging ways, in alignment with the national vision of a science-led Viksit Bharat.\n\n***\n\nNKR/AK/AV\n\n(Release ID: 2234232)\n\nVisitor Counter : 136\n\nRead this release in:\n\nUrdu\n\n,\n\nहिन्दी\n\nMinistry of Science & Technology\n\nCSIR and its Laboratories Celebrate National Science Day 2026 Across the Country with Lectures, Demonstrations and Public Outreach\n\nPosted On:\n01 MAR 2026 5:56PM by PIB Delhi\n\nNew Delhi:\n The Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) and its laboratories celebrated National Science Day 2026 across the nation through a series of engaging activities including lectures, student visits, demonstrations, and public outreach programmes aimed at promoting scientific awareness and curiosity among young minds and the general public.\n\nThis year’s National Science Day was observed under the theme “Women in Science: Catalyzing Viksit Bharat”, highlighting the pivotal role of women in advancing scientific innovation and shaping a developed and self-reliant India.\n\nAs part of the celebrations in the national capital, the CSIR–Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) and the Science Communication and Dissemination Directorate (SCDD), CSIR Headquarters, organised a special programme to commemorate the life and legacy of Nobel Laureate Sir C.
