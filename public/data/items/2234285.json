The vessel represents a revival of India’s centuries-old maritime craftsmanship and reflects the nation’s commitment to rediscovering and preserving its Indic knowledge systems. Conceptualised from a 5th century CE depiction in the Ajanta Caves and constructed under the supervision of the Indian Navy in collaboration with traditional artisans, the vessel embodies the fusion of traditional craftsmanship with modern naval engineering validation.\n\nINSV Kaundinya sailed from Porbandar on 29 Dec 2025 for Muscat, retracing ancient maritime routes once used by Indian mariners. She arrived at Port Sultan Qaboos on 14 Jan 2026, where she received a ceremonial welcome in the presence of Omani dignitaries and members of the Indian diaspora. During her stay, the vessel was opened to visitors, serving as a floating symbol of maritime heritage and cultural diplomacy. The voyage significantly strengthened India–Oman linkages, rooted in millennia of trade in spices, textiles and frankincense, and reinforced shared seafaring traditions across the Arabian Sea.\n\nThe expedition highlighted the Indian Navy’s role not only as a maritime security provider but also as a custodian of India’s civilisational maritime legacy. Named after the legendary mariner Kaundinya, the vessel symbolises India’s ancient tradition of oceanic navigation and outreach across the Indian Ocean. Her successful voyage stands as a testament to the resilience of traditional maritime construction practices and the professionalism of her crew.\n\nThe flag-in at Mumbai will mark the culmination of a landmark maritime heritage revival project and underscore India’s continuing commitment to maritime outreach, cultural diplomacy and the preservation of traditional nautical craftsmanship.\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nVM/SKY                                                                                                     41/26\n\n(Release ID: 2234285)\n\nVisitor Counter : 133\n\nRead this release in:\n\nUrdu\n\nMinistry of Defence\n\nINSV KAUNDINYA TO BE FLAGGED INTO MUMBAI HARBOUR\n\nPosted On:\n01 MAR 2026 8:09PM by PIB Delhi\n\nThe Indian Naval Sailing Vessel (INSV) Kaundinya will be ceremonially flagged into Mumbai Harbour on\n02 Mar 2026 by Shri Sanjay Seth, Raksha Rajya Mantri\n.\n\n\nThe flag-in ceremony marks the successful completion of the vessel’s\n\nmaiden overseas voyage to the Sultanate of Oman and her historic return passage across the Arabian Sea\n, reaffirming India’s enduring maritime heritage and India–Oman linkages across the Indian Ocean.\n\nINSV Kaundinya is a traditionally constructed stitched ship, built entirely using ancient Indian techniques in which wooden planks are hand-stitched together using coir rope and sealed with natural resins.
