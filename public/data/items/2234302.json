On this occasion, Maharashtra Chief Minister Shri Devendra Fadnavis, Deputy Chief Ministers Shri Eknath Shinde and Smt. Sunetra Pawar, along with many other dignitaries, were present.\n\nIn his address, Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation Shri Amit Shah said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi decided to commemorate the 350\nth\n Shaheedi Diwas of Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji at the national level, which is a matter of great fortune for the entire country. He said that Maharashtra Chief Minister Shri Devendra Fadnavis has organized special programmes across Maharashtra to reach the biography of Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji to the youth. He said that if the ninth Guru, Shri Tegh Bahadur Ji, had not given his martyrdom to save Hinduism and Hindus, not a single Hindu would have survived in the entire world. Shri Shah said that followers of Sanatan Dharma across India and the world express their gratitude to Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji for enduring torture and giving his martyrdom to save Hinduism.\n\nUnion Home Minister Shri Amit Shah said that the core of the Sikh tradition has been unity, brotherhood, inclusivity, and bravery, and these very elements have been incorporated into the Guru Granth Sahib. He said that the tenth Guru Gobind Singh Ji, included the hymns (pads) of many renowned saints such as Sant Namdev ji, Narsi Mehta ji, Sant Kabir ji, Sant Ravidas ji and others in the Guru Granth Sahib. He said that the Government of Maharashtra has connected many communities with Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji.\n\nUnion Home Minister Shri Amit Shah said that Guru Nanak Dev Ji gave humanity three simple yet profound principles- “Naam Japo, Kirat Karo, and Vand Chhako”. This means: keep chanting and meditating on the name of God, perform honest work and sing His praises, and share meals together. He said it reflects mutual partnership, and this very tradition later evolved into langar and the shared community kitchen, which became a great source of strength in fighting against the Mughals. Shri Shah said that Guru Nanak Dev Ji Maharaj revived and gave new life to India's thousands-of-years-old tradition, and Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji was also a follower of the same tradition.\n\nShri Amit Shah said that Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji did not hesitate even for a moment in protecting Hinduism and its followers, and he fulfilled whatever he had resolved to do. He said that when the Kashmiri Pandits faced hardships, their representatives gathered together and approached Guru Sahib seeking protection. Shri Shah said that since then, Kashmiri Pandits living across the entire world have remained connected with Guru Sahib.\n\nUnion Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation said that the contributions made by Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji for Hindus and for the entire nation can never be forgotten. He said that during Aurangzeb’s rule, a sacrifice witnessed in 1675 not only strengthened the courage of the people across the country but also broke the power of Aurangzeb’s oppression. He said that Maharashtra and Punjab share a very deep relationship, and it was this very land that the Tenth Guru chose for relinquishing his mortal body. He further said that the devotional tradition of Sant Namdev Ji, whose teachings are reflected in the hymns of the Sikh Gurus, continues to be preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib even today.\n\nUnion Home Minister Shri Amit Shah said that Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji sacrificed his life to protect the Hindus and Sikhs across the country, and Guru Gobind Singh Ji Maharaj established the Khalsa Panth. He said that, holding a rosary (Mala) in one hand and a spear (Bhala) in the other, he organized the Sikhs against Aurangzeb’s atrocities and initiated a great struggle.\n\nUnion Home Minister Shri Amit Shah said that from Guru Nanak Dev Ji Maharaj to Guru Gobind Singh Ji, all the Gurus worked at different times and in different ways to strengthen society and safeguard religion against several generations of Mughal oppression. He explained that Guru Nanak Dev Ji Maharaj propagated knowledge and eliminated many social evils and superstitions, Guru Angad Dev Ji spread the message of education, Guru Amar Das Ji promoted social harmony and equality, Guru Ram Das Ji established many institutions to provide a strong foundation, Guru Arjan Dev Ji worked towards cultural inclusivity, Guru Hargobind Sahib gave the philosophy of defending devotion and faith, Guru Har Rai Ji spread the message of compassion throughout the world, Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji presented before the entire world the form of Hind ki Chadar, and Guru Gobind Singh Ji established the Khalsa Panth while spreading the light of Guru Granth Sahib. Shri Shah said that the ten Gurus of the Sikh Panth established a tradition that is exemplary not only for India but for the entire world. He said that, drawing inspiration from the lives of all ten Gurus, all citizens of the country should unite against religious conversion.\n\n***\n\n\n\nRK/PR/PS\n\n(Release ID: 2234302)\n\nVisitor Counter : 70\n\nRead this release in:\n\nMarathi\n\nMinistry of Home Affairs\n\nUnion Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation, Shri Amit Shah pays tribute to Guru Shri Tegh Bahadur Ji and addresses the gathered congregation at the ceremony marking the 350th Shaheedi Diwas of Guru Sahib in Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra\n\nPrime Minister Shri Narendra Modi decided to commemorate the 350th Shaheedi Diwas of Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji at the national level, which is a matter of great fortune for the entire country\nIf the ninth Guru, Shri Tegh Bahadur Ji, had not sacrificed his life to protect Hinduism, not a single Hindu would have remained in the entire world\nShri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, who sacrificed even his head for the protection of faith and culture, will remain our inspiration for generations to come\nShri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji became a shield against the cruelty of Mughal invaders inflicted upon the Kashmiri Pandits\nI congratulate the Government of Maharashtra for bringing to light the service activities carried out by every community devoted to serving the Gurus\nThere is no other figure in history as valiant as ‘Sarvansdani’ Guru Gobind Singh Ji, who sacrificed his entire family for his faith\nBy giving the mantra “Naam Japo, Kirat Karo, and Vand Chhako,” Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji Maharaj infused new life into India’s thousands-year-old tradition\nFrom Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji Maharaj to Guru Gobind Singh Ji, all the Gurus strengthened society in different ways at different times to protect the faith from several generations of the Mughals\nDrawing inspiration from the lives of all ten Gurus, all citizens of the country should unite against religious conversion\n\nPosted On:\n01 MAR 2026 9:02PM by PIB Delhi\n\nUnion Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation, Shri Amit Shah paid tribute to Guru Shri Tegh Bahadur Ji and addressed the gathered congregation at the ceremony marking the 350\nth\n Shaheedi Diwas of Guru Sahib in Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra.
